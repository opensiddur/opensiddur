The Open Siddur Project aims to produce a free software toolkit 
for making high-quality custom Jewish liturgical books such as 
haggadot, siddurim, and bentchers that can be displayed on screen 
or printed to paper. The project's goals include producing a 
reliable source text, enabling personalization and customization 
of the text for local rites and customs 
and selective inclusion of multilingual translations, transliterations, 
instructions, notes, and commentaries.

To accomplish it, we are to creating a collaborative publishing platform 
built around a social network of individuals passionate about the siddur, 
some wanting to craft their own siddur, 
others wanting to use it as an educational tool, 
or for sharing prayers, translations, commentaries, art, and layout templates 
for new siddurim. The mission of the Open Siddur Project is further 
described in our [Mission Statement](http://opensiddur.org/development/mission/) 
and encompasses the values of pluralism (acceptance for the diversity of 
Jewish cultural expression), 
historical awareness (the text of the siddur is an aggregate of 
thousands of years of creatively inspired works), 
and individual freedom.

The coding project is divided into three major parts:
* Schema: A defined XML format for storing liturgical materials, based on the 
[Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](http://www.tei-c.org) XML schema.
* Back-end: A database and REST API for storing and accessing siddur data.
* Front-end: The web-based editing application.

Volunteer coders are always welcome. We are, in particular, 
looking for web/mobile user interface programmers.

This site serves as the project's code repository, 
code documentation, and issue tracker.

Current development progress is being tracked on the github wiki 
and in the issue tracker. 

Many of the texts that have been contributed to date are 
distributed at [opensiddur.org](http://opensiddur.org)

Comments and bug reports from anyone are welcome.
