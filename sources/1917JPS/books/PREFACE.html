         <h2>PREFACE</h2>
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The following is from the preface to the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English: 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The sacred task of translating the Word of God, as revealed to Israel through lawgiver, prophet, psalmist, and sage, began
         at an early date. According to an ancient rabbinic interpretation, Joshua had the Torah engraved upon the stones of the altar
         (Joshua 8:32) not in the original Hebrew alone, but in all the languages of mankind, which were held to be seventy, in order
         that all men might become acquainted with the words of the Scriptures. This statement, with its universalistic tendency, is,
         of course, a reflex of later times, when the Hebrew Scriptures had become a subject of curiosity and perhaps also of anxiety
         to the pagan or semi-pagan world. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>While this tradition contains an element of truth, it is certain that the primary object of translating the Bible was to minister
         to a need nearer home. Upon the establishment of the Second Commonwealth under Ezra and Nehemiah, it became imperative to
         make the Torah of God 'distinct and giving sense' through the means of interpretation (Nehemiah 8:8 and 13:24), that the Word
         of God might be understood by all the people. The Rabbis perceived in this activity of the first generation of the Sopherim
         the origin of the Aramaic translation known as the Targum, first made orally and afterwards committed to writing, which was
         necessitated by the fact that Israel had forgotten the sacred language, and spoke the idiom current in a large part of western
         Asia. All this, however, is veiled in obscurity, as is the whole inner history of the Jews during the Persian rule. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The historic necessity for translation was repeated with all the great changes in Israel's career. It is enough to point to
         the Septuagint, or the Greek translation of the Scriptures, the product of Israel's contact with the Hellenistic civilization
         dominating the world at that time; to the Arabic translation by the Gaon Saadya, when the great majority of the Jewish people
         came under the sceptre of Mohammedan rulers; and to the German translation by Mendelssohn and his school, at the dawn of a
         new epoch, which brought the Jews in Europe, most of whom spoke a German dialect, into closer contact with their neighbours.
         These translations are all historical products intimately connected with Israel's wanderings among the nations and with the
         great events of mankind in general. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Ancient and continuous as this task of translation was, it would be a mistake to think that there were no misgivings about
         it. At least it is certain that opinions 
         
         
         
         
         iv were divided as to the desirability of such undertakings. While Philo and his Alexandrian coreligionists looked upon the
         translation of the Seventy as a work of inspired men, the Palestinian Rabbis subsequently considered the day on which the
         Septuagint was completed as one of the most unfortunate in Israel's history, seeing that the Torah could never be adequately
         translated. And there are indications enough that the consequences of such translations were not all of a desirable nature.
         However, in view of the eagerness with which they were undertaken almost in every land and in every great epoch of the world's
         history, it is evident that the people at large approved of such translations, thinking them to be a heave-offering to the
         Lord of each newly acquired vernacular adopted in the course of the ever-changing conditions of history, and in particular
         a tribute to the beauty of Japheth dwelling in the spiritual tents of Israel. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The greatest change in the life of Israel during the last two generations was his renewed acquaintance with English-speaking
         civilization. Out of a handful of immigrants from Central Europe and the East who saw the shores of the New World, or even
         of England and her colonies, we have grown under Providence both in numbers and in importance, so that we constitute now the
         greatest section of Israel living in a single country outside of Russia. We are only following in the footsteps of our great
         predecessors when, with the growth of our numbers, we have applied ourselves to the sacred task of preparing a new translation
         of the Bible into the English language, which, unless all signs fail, is to become the current speech of the majority of the
         children of Israel. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The need of such a translation was felt long ago. Mention may here be made of the work of Isaac Leeser in America, which was
         both preceded and followed by two translations produced in England: the one by Dr. A. Benisch, the other by Dr. Michael Friedlander.
         The most popular, however, among these translations was that of Lesser, which was not only the accepted version in all the
         synagogues of the United States, but was also reproduced in England. Its great merit consisted in the fact that it incorporated
         all the improvements proposed by the Mendelssohn School and their successors, whose combined efforts were included and further
         developed in the so-called Zunz Bible, which enjoyed a certain authority among German Jews for several generations. With the
         advance of time and the progress made in almost all departments of Bible study, it was found that Leeser's translation would
         bear improvement and recasting. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Steps leading to the preparation of a new translation into the English language were taken by the Jewish Publication Society
         of America in 1892. It was intended to secure, if possible, through the co-operation of scholars in the United States and
         in Great Britain, a new translation of each book, and to place it in the 
         
         
         
         
         v hands of an Editorial Committee, who by correspondence with the translators should harmonize the results of the work of
         the individual contributors. This method was followed until 1901 under the general direction of Doctor Marcus Jastrow, Editor-in-Chief,
         with Doctor Kaufman Kohler and Doctor Frederick de Sola Mendes as the other members of the Editorial Committee.* 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>*There is given herewith a list of the translations prepared for the Society: Genesis, Max Landsberg, Rochester, N. Y. Exodus
         and Leviticus, L. N. Dembitz (deceased), Louisville, Ky. Numbers, David Philipson, Cincinnati, Ohio. Deuteronomy, F. de Sola
         Mendes, New York. Joshua, Joseph H. Hertz, London, England. Judges, Stephen S. Wise, New York. II Samuel, Bernard Drachman,
         New York. Jeremiah, Sabato Morais (deceased), Philadelphia, Pa. Ezekiel, Henry W. Schneeberger, Baltimore, Md. Joel, Oscar
         Cohen (deceased), Mobile, Ala. Amos, H. Pereira Mendes, Now York. Obadiah and Jonah, J. Voorsanger (deceased), San Francisco,
         California. Micah, Maurice H. Harris, New York. Nahum, L. Mayer (deceased), Pittsburgh, Pa. Zephaniah, M. Schlesinger, Albany,
         N. Y. Haggai, S. Mendelsohn, Wilmington, N. C. Malachi, D. Davidson, New York. Job, Marcus Jastrow (deceased), Philadelphia,
         Pa. Ruth, Joseph Krauskopf, Philadelphia, Pa. Ecclesiastes, Gustav Gottheil (deceased), New York. Esther, William Rosenau,
         Baltimore, Md. I and II Chronicles, M. Mielziner (deceased), Cincinnati, Ohio.) 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>It became apparent in 1901 that by this procedure the publication of a translation of the entire Hebrew Bible would be indefinitely
         delayed, and accordingly the Book of Psalms, translated by Doctor Kohler and revised by his colleagues, was given to the press
         and issued in 1903. The death of Doctor Jastrow in that year required the formation of a new committee under the chairmanship
         of Doctor Solomon Schechter. This committee, however, soon found that the method adopted was too complex, and that it was
         impossible to accomplish by correspondence the extensive work required. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>In 1908 the Jewish Publication Society of America and the Central Conference of American Rabbis reached an agreement to cooperate
         in bringing out the new 
         
         
         
         
         vi translation upon a revised plan of having the entire work done by a Board of Editors instead of endeavoring to harmonize
         the translations of individual contributors. As a result of this understanding the present Board, composed of Doctor Solomon
         Schechter, Doctor Cyrus Adler, and Doctor Joseph Jacobs, representing the Jewish Publication Society of America, and Doctor
         Kaufman Kohler, Doctor David Philipson, and Doctor Samuel Schulman, representing the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
         was constituted, and by mutual agreement Professor Max L. Margolis was chosen as the seventh member, he to be the Editor-in-Chief
         of the work and Secretary to the Editorial Board, of which Doctor Cyrus Adler was elected Chairman. Incidentally the selection
         thus made resulted in an equal representation of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America at New York, of the Hebrew Union
         College at Cincinnati, and of the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning at Philadelphia. For one year Professor
         Israel Friedlaender acted as a member of the Board in the stead of Doctor Schechter. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The method employed by the Board was as follows: 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>In preparing the manuscript for consideration by the Board of Editors, Professor Margolis took into account the existing English
         versions, the standard commentaries, ancient and modern, the translations already made for the Jewish Publication Society
         of America, the divergent renderings from the Revised Version prepared for the Jews of England, the marginal notes of the
         Revised Version, and the changes of the American Committee of Revisers. Due weight was given to the ancient versions as establishing
         a tradition of interpretation, notably the Septuagint and the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, the Targums,
         the Peshitta, the Vulgate, and the Arabic version of Saadya. Talmudic and midrashic allusions and all available Jewish commentators,
         both the great medieval authorities, like Rashi, Kimhi, and Ibn Ezra, and the moderns S. D. Luzzatto, Malbim, and Ehrlich,
         as well as all the important non-Jewish commentators, were consulted. On this basis, a manuscript was prepared by the Editor-in-Chief
         and a copy sent to every member of the Board of Editors. Sixteen meetings, covering a period of seven years and occupying
         one hundred and sixty working days, were held, at which the proposals in this manuscript and many additional suggestions by
         the members of the Board were considered. Each point was thoroughly discussed, and the view of the majority was incorporated
         into the manuscript. When the Board was evenly divided, the Chairman cast the deciding vote. From time to time subcommittees
         were at work upon points left open, and their reports, submitted to the Board, were discussed and voted upon. The proof of
         the entire work was sent to each member of the Board for revision, and the new proposals which were made by one or another
         were in turn submitted to a 
         
         
         
         
         vii vote by correspondence and to a final vote at the last meeting of the Board, held in October-November, 1915. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The present translation is the first for which a group of men representative of Jewish learning among English-speaking Jews
         assume joint responsibility, all previous efforts in the English language having been the work of individual translators.
         It has a character of its own. It aims to combine the spirit of Jewish tradition with the results of biblical scholarship,
         ancient, medieval, and modern. It gives to the Jewish world a translation of the Scriptures done by men imbued with the Jewish
         consciousness, while the non-Jewish world, it is hoped, will welcome a translation that presents many passages from the Jewish
         traditional point of view. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The repeated efforts by Jews in the field of biblical translation show their sentiment toward translations prepared by other
         denominations. The dominant feature of this sentiment, apart from the thought that the christological interpretations in non-Jewish
         translations are out of place in a Jewish Bible, is and was that the Jew cannot afford to have his Bible translation prepared
         for him by others. He cannot have it as a gift, even as he cannot borrow his soul from others. If a new country and a new
         language metamorphose him into a new man, the duty of this new man is to prepare a new garb and a new method of expression
         for what is most sacred and most dear to him. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>We are, it is hardly needful to say, deeply grateful for the works of our non-Jewish predecessors, such as the Authorised
         Version with its admirable diction, which can never be surpassed, as well as for the Revised Version with its ample learning--but
         they are not ours. The Editors have not only used these famous English versions, but they have gone back to the earlier translations
         of Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale, the Bishops' Bible, and the Douai Version, which is the authorised English translation of
         the Vulgate used by the Roman Catholics; in a word, upon doubtful points in style, all English versions have been drawn upon.
         The renditions of parts of the Hebrew Scriptures by Lowth and others in the eighteenth century and by Cheyne and Driver in
         our own days were likewise consulted. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>As to the text and order of the biblical books, the present translation follows Jewish tradition, the Sacred Scriptures having
         come down in a definite compass and in a definite text. They are separated into three divisions: Law (Torah, Pentateuch),
         Prophets (Nebi'im), Writings (Ketubim). Each of these possesses a different degree of holiness or authority. In the Prophets
         and the Writings the order of the books varies in manuscripts or among Jewish authorities; but there is absolute agreement
         as to the compass of these two divisions, and no book is 
         
         
         
         
         transposed from the one into the other. Thus Ruth, Lamentations, and Daniel are all placed in the division of Writings--not
         among the Prophets, as in non-Jewish versions. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>With every step by which each of the three parts was sealed, nothing to be added or to be taken away, the text was likewise
         fixed and thenceforth made the object of zealous watchfulness. Even with regard to the latest book of our Scriptures, we read
         its text substantially in the form in which the great Rabbi Akiba read it, he who said that the system by which the sacred
         text was guarded constituted a fence about the Scriptures. In that system, at first oral and later committed to writing, the
         letters were actually counted and lists made, to the end that no alterations should creep in at the hands of careless scribes.
         The first to collect the notes known as Masorah was Jacob ben Haim Ibn Adonijah, the editor of the second Rabbinic Bible.
         In our own day many scholars have been prominent in this field of labour, chief among whom are Wolf Heidenheim, S. Frensdorff,
         S. Baer, and C. D. Ginsburg. We have followed Baer's text

         in the Synagogue with regard to consonants, but also with regard to its signs standing for vowels and accents, both of which
         embody the interpretation accepted by the Synagogue. While in the scrolls which are read in the Synagogue the bare consonants
         are alone permitted, readers must prepare themselves from copies allowed for private use, in ancient times written and now
         printed, which contain the additional signs for vowels and accents. A translation must naturally follow the guide of the latter.
         Moreover, the public reader is bound in certain cases to substitute mentally other consonants in the place of those found
         in the scrolls, in accordance with the marginal annotations in the copies intended for private use. These variants are taken
         traditionally for corrections, and the public reader who persists in ignoring them forfeits his position. It is true that
         in the case of such variations the Jewish commentators of the Middle Ages sought to elicit a meaning also from the textual
         reading, and seem here and there tacitly to give it preference, but all this partakes of the nature of private judgment, and
         does not affect the uniform practice of the public readings in the Synagogue. While as a rule the margin (Kere) was followed,
         we have occasionally adopted the consonants of the text (Ketib), as for instance in Ps 139:16, and 2Ch 24:27 34:9.
         
         
         
         
         ix 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>A translation destined for the people can follow only one text, and that must be the traditional. Nevertheless a translator
         is not a transcriber of the text. His principal function is to make the Hebrew intelligible. Faithful though he must be to
         the Hebrew idiom, he will nevertheless be forced by the genius of the English language to use circumlocution, to add a word
         or two, to alter the sequence of words, and the like. In general, our rule has been that, where the word or words added are
         implied in the Hebrew construction, no device is used to mark the addition; where, on the other hand, the addition is not
         at once to be inferred from the original wording and yet seems necessary for the understanding, it has been enclosed in brackets.
         Naturally opinion will differ as to what may be deemed an addition warranted by the Hebrew construction and what may not,
         but as intelligibility was the principal aim, the Editors have felt justified in making their additions, sparingly it is true,
         but nevertheless as often as the occasion required. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>We have thought it proper to limit the margin to the shortest compass, confining it to such elucidation of and references
         to the literal meaning as are absolutely necessary for making the translation intelligible. The Rabbis enumerate eighteen
         instances in which the scribes consciously altered the text. We have called attention to a change of this nature in Jud 18:30.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Personal pronouns referring to the Deity have been capitalized. As an aid to clearness direct discourse has been indicated
         by quotation marks. In the prophetical writings, where the speech of the prophet imperceptibly glides into the words of the
         Deity, and in the legal portions of the Pentateuch, it has been thought best to use quotation marks sparingly. Although the
         spelling of proper names in the English Bible in many instances deviates somewhat from an accurate representation of the Hebrew,
         it has nevertheless been deemed wise, owing to the familiarity of Hebrew names in their usual English form, generally to retain
         the current spelling. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>In all externals this translation is especially adapted for use in synagogue and school. The Keriat ha-Torah, or the reading
         of the section from the Five Books of Moses, is the central feature of the Synagogue service. The Pentateuch is divided into
         fifty-four sections; beginning with the Sabbath following the Feast of Tabernacles, the readings on the Sabbaths of the year
         are taken in their order from the Five Books of Moses. The reading consists either of the whole section or of a selected portion.
         There was a variant custom according to which the reading of the Torah extended over a period of three years instead of one
         year. However, the one year cycle gradually superseded the three year cycle, and has become the universal custom in the Synagogue.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The Pentateuchal readings are supplemented by readings from the Prophets 
         
         
         
         
         x known as Haftarot. Readings from the third portion of the Bible, though customary at one time, have now largely fallen into
         disuse. The five small books known as the Five Megillot are given a place in the Synagogue service in their entirety. On the
         feast of Purim the book of Esther is read; the book of Lamentations is read on Tish'ah be-Ab (Ninth of Ab), the fast-day observed
         in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem; Song of Songs, Ruth, and Ecclesiastes are read respectively on the Feast
         of Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.

         the public. The final meeting in November, nineteen hundred and fifteen, was closed with a prayer of thanks to God that the
         great task was completed and that the group which during seven years had toiled together was intact. Since that day two of
         our number have been called to the academy on high, Solomon Schechter and Joseph Jacobs, be their memory for a blessing. We
         grieve that it was not granted these cherished colleagues to live to see the final fruition of their labours; their wholehearted
         and devoted service is herewith recorded in grateful appreciation. In all humility their co-workers submit this version to
         the Jewish people in the confident hope that it will aid them in the knowledge of the Word of God.
