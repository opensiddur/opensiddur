         </h3>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in
         mount Gilboa. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua,
         the sons of Saul. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was in anguish by reason of the archers. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then said Saul unto his armour-bearer: ‘Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
         make a mock of me.’ But his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon
         it. 
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died. <span class="verse-number">6</span>So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that [Israel] fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they
         forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.  <span class="verse-number">8</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen
         in mount Gilboa. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry
         the tidings unto their idols, and to the people. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, <span class="verse-number">12</span>all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried
         their bones under the terebinth in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.  <span class="verse-number">13</span>So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because of the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of a ghost, to inquire thereby, <span class="verse-number">14</span>and inquired not of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; therefore He slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

         and was made chief. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And David waxed greater and greater; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts was with him.  <span class="verse-number">10</span>Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who held strongly with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel,
         to make him king, according to the word of the 
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> concerning Israel. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains; he
         lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.  <span class="verse-number">12</span>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. <span class="verse-number">13</span>He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full
         of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. <span class="verse-number">14</span>But they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> saved them by a great victory.  <span class="verse-number">15</span>And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, unto the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were
         encamped in the valley of Rephaim. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And David longed, and said: ‘Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate! ’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate,
         and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, <span class="verse-number">19</span>and said: ‘My God forbid it me, that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy?
         for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.’ Therefore he would not 
         
         
         
         
         
         drink it. These things did the three mighty men.  <span class="verse-number">20</span>And

            									Chapter 12
         </h3>Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he was yet shut up because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among
         the mighty men, his helpers in war. <span class="verse-number">2</span>They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in 
         
         
         
         
         
         slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow; they were of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin. <span class="verse-number">3</span>The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Beracah,
         and Jehu the Anathothite; <span class="verse-number">4</span>and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; <span class="verse-number">5</span>and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite;  <span class="verse-number">6</span>Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Hariphite;  <span class="verse-number">7</span>Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; <span class="verse-number">8</span>and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of the troop.  <span class="verse-number">9</span>And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valour, men trained
         for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes
         upon the mountains;  <span class="verse-number">10</span>Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third; <span class="verse-number">11</span>Mashmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth; <span class="verse-number">12</span>Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh; <span class="verse-number">13</span>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth; <span class="verse-number">14</span>Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. <span class="verse-number">15</span>These of the sons of Gad were captains of the host; he that was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand.
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>These are they that went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all its banks; and they put to flight all
         them 
         of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.  <span class="verse-number">17</span>And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold unto David. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them: ‘If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall
         be knit unto you; but if ye be come to betray me to mine adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our
         fathers look thereon, and give judgment.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>Then the spirit clothed Amasai, who was chief of the captains:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Thine are we, David,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And on thy side, thou son of Jesse;

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And peace be to thy helpers;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>For thy God helpeth thee.  Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.  <span class="verse-number">20</span>Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but

         </div>they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying: ‘He will fall away to his master
         Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
         and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And they helped David against the troop, for they were all mighty men of valour, and were 
         
         
         
         
         
         captains in the host. <span class="verse-number">23</span>For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God.  <span class="verse-number">24</span>And these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of
         Saul to him, according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">25</span>The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war. <span class="verse-number">26</span>Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. <span class="verse-number">27</span>Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And Jehoiada was the leader of the house of Aaron, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred; <span class="verse-number">29</span>and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand; for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their
         allegiance to the house of Saul. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous men in their fathers’houses.
         <span class="verse-number">32</span>And of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them
         were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment. <span class="verse-number">34</span>Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the host, 
         that could set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand; and that could order the battle
         array, and were not of double heart. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And of the Danites that could set the battle in array, twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. <span class="verse-number">37</span>And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand. <span class="verse-number">38</span>And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all manner
         of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand. <span class="verse-number">39</span>All these, being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a whole heart to Hebron, to make David king over
         all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. <span class="verse-number">40</span>And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had made preparation for them. <span class="verse-number">41</span>Moreover they that were nigh unto them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels,
         and on mules, and on oxen, victual of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
         in abundance; for there was joy in Israel.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 13
         </h3>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And David said unto all the assembly 
         
         
         
         
         
         of Israel: ‘If it seem good unto you, and if it be of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, let us send abroad everywhere unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests
         and Levites that are in their cities that have open land about them, that they may gather themselves unto us; <span class="verse-number">3</span>and let us bring back the ark of our God to us; for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. <span class="verse-number">5</span>So David assembled all Israel together, from Shihor the brook of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark
         of God from Kiriath-jearim.  <span class="verse-number">6</span>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence
         the ark of God, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> that sitteth upon the cherubim, whereon is called the Name. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, [and brought it] out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And David and all Israel played before God with all their might; even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and
         with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Uzza, and He smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And David was 
         displeased, because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had broken forth upon Uzza; and that place was called

         that ye may bring up the ark of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it. <span class="verse-number">13</span>For because ye [bore it] not at the first, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought Him not according to the ordinance.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And the children of the 
         
         
         
         
         
         Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the bars thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  <span class="verse-number">16</span>And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and
         harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy. <span class="verse-number">17</span>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari
         their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; <span class="verse-number">18</span>and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab,
         and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphalehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. <span class="verse-number">19</span>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan [, were appointed], with cymbals of brass to sound aloud; <span class="verse-number">20</span>and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set
         to Alamoth; <span class="verse-number">21</span>and Mattithiah, and Eliphalehu, and Mikneiahu, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith, to lead.
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song; he was master in the song, because he was skilful. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And Berechiah and Elkanah were door-keepers for the ark. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with
         
         the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.  <span class="verse-number">25</span>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the
         master of the singers in the song; and David had upon him an ephod of linen. <span class="verse-number">28</span>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> with shouting, and with sound of the horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and making
         merry; and she despised him in her heart.

         </h3>And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt-offerings
         and peace-offerings before God. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of

            									Chapter 17
         </h3>And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet: ‘Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar,
         but the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> dwelleth under curtains.’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Nathan said unto David: ‘Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying: <span class="verse-number">4</span>‘Go and tell David My servant: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Thou shalt not build Me a house to dwell in; <span class="verse-number">5</span>for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day; but have [gone] from tent to tent,
         and from one tabernacle [to another[. <span class="verse-number">6</span>In all places wherein I have walked among all Israel, spoke I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to
         feed My people, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar? <span class="verse-number">7</span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people Israel;
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make
         thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may 
         dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the
         first, <span class="verse-number">10</span>even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell
         thee that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will build thee a house. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed
         after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. <span class="verse-number">12</span>He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. <span class="verse-number">13</span>I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took it from
         him that was before thee; <span class="verse-number">14</span>but I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.  <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then David the king went in, and sat before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and he said: ‘Who am I, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far? <span class="verse-number">17</span>And this was a small thing in Thine eyes, O God; but Thou hast spoken of Thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and
         hast regarded me after the manner of a man of high degree, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God. <span class="verse-number">18</span>What can David say yet more unto Thee concerning the honour which is done to Thy servant? for Thou knowest Thy 
         
         
         
         
         
         servant. <span class="verse-number">19</span>O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for Thy servant’s sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these
         great things. <span class="verse-number">20</span>O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, there is none like Thee, neither is there any God beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And who is like Thy people Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people, to make Thee
         a name by great and tremendous things, in driving out nations from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem out of Egypt.
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>For Thy people Israel didst Thou make Thine own people for ever; and Thou, <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, becamest their God. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And now, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, let the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as
         Thou hast spoken. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Yea, let it be established, and let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and the house of David Thy servant shall be established before Thee.
         <span class="verse-number">25</span>For Thou, O my God, hast revealed to Thy servant that Thou wilt build him a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart
         to pray before Thee. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And now, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Thou alone art God, and hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant; <span class="verse-number">27</span>and now it hath pleased Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, hast blessed, 
         and so let [Thy servant] be blessed for ever.’

            									Chapter 19
         </h3>And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And David said: 
         ‘l will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.’ So David sent messengers to
         comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun: ‘Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent
         comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their hips, and sent them
         away. <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly
         ashamed. And the king said: ‘Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.’  <span class="verse-number">6</span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand
         talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Aram-naharaim, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah. <span class="verse-number">7</span>So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; who came and encamped before Medeba.
         And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the 
         
         
         
         
         
         host of the mighty men. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And the children of Ammon came out and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings that were come were
         by themselves in the field.  <span class="verse-number">10</span>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put
         them in array against the Arameans. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they put themselves in array against the
         children of Ammon. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And he said: ‘If the Arameans be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
         thee, then I will help thee. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> do that which seemeth Him good.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle to meet the Arameans; and they fled before him. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
         into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse-number">16</span>And when the Arameans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and brought out the Arameans
         that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon 
         them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Arameans, they fought
         with him. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And the Arameans fled before Israel; and David slew of the Arameans the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand
         footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served
         him; neither would the Arameans help the children of Ammon any more.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 20
         </h3>And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led forth the
         power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.
         And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And David took the crown of Malcam from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones
         in it; and it was set upon David’s head; and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus
         did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the 
         
         
         
         
         
         Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giants; and they were subdued. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the
         staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six [on each
         hand], and six [on each foot]; and he also was born unto the giant. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him. <span class="verse-number">8</span>These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 21
         </h3>And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people: ‘Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word,
         that I may know the sum of them.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Joab said: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> make His people a hundred times so many more as they are; but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why
         doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a
         hundred thousand men that drew sword; and Judah was four 
         hundred three-score and ten thousand men that drew sword. <span class="verse-number">6</span>But Levi and Benjamin he did not number among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.  <span class="verse-number">7</span>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He smote Israel. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And David said unto God: ‘I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing; but now, put away, I beseech Thee, the iniquity
         of Thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke unto Gad, David’s seer, saying: <span class="verse-number">10</span>‘Go and speak unto David, saying: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>So Gad came to David, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Take which thou wilt: <span class="verse-number">12</span>either three years of famine; or three months to be swept away before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh
         thee; or else three days the sword of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to Him that sent me.’
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And David said unto Gad: ‘I am in a great strait; let me fall now into the hand of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for very great are His mercies; and let me not fall into the hand of man.’  <span class="verse-number">14</span>So the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was about to destroy, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> beheld, and He repented Him of 
         
         
         
         
         
         the evil, and said to the destroying angel: ‘It is enough; now stay thy hand.’ And the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> standing between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and
         the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And David said unto God: ‘Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very
         wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let Thy hand, I pray Thee, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against Thy people, that they should be plagued.’  <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed down to David with
         his face to the ground. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then David said to Ornan: ‘Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for the full price shalt thou give it me; that the 
         plague may be stayed from the people.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And Ornan said unto David: ‘Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes; lo, I give thee the
         oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing-instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all’<span class="verse-number">24</span>And king David said to Ornan: ‘Nay, but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that which is thine for
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And David built there an altar unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded the angel; and he put up his sword back into the sheath thereof.  <span class="verse-number">28</span>At that time, when David saw that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. <span class="verse-number">29</span>For the tabernacle of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. <span class="verse-number">30</span>But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was terrified because of the sword of the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.

         eight thousand. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and six thousand were officers and judges; <span class="verse-number">5</span>and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> ‘with the instruments which I made to praise therewith.’  <span class="verse-number">6</span>And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Of the Gershonites: Ladan, and Shimei. <span class="verse-number">8</span>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. <span class="verse-number">9</span>The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’houses of Ladan. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; 
         therefore they became a fathers’house in one reckoning.  <span class="verse-number">12</span>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. <span class="verse-number">13</span>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should be sanctified as most holy, he and his sons for

         the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; <span class="verse-number">18</span>and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, even the cherubim, that spread
         out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">19</span>‘All this [do I give thee] in writing, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath made me wise by His hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.’  <span class="verse-number">20</span>And David said to Solomon his son: ‘Be strong and of good courage, and do it; fear not, nor be dismayed; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God, even my God, is with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house
         of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> be finished. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God; and there shall
         be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service; also the captains and all
         the people will be wholly at thy commandment.’  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 29
         </h3>And David the king said unto all the congregation: ‘Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and
         the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Now I have prepared with all my might for the 
         house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of
         brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones,
         and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and
         silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, <span class="verse-number">4</span>even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay
         the walls of the houses; <span class="verse-number">5</span>of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands
         of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>?’  <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then the princes of the fathers’houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
         with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly; <span class="verse-number">7</span>and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten
         thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, 
         
         
         
         
         
         under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a whole heart they offered willingly to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.  <span class="verse-number">10</span>Wherefore David blessed the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> before all the congregation; and David said: ‘Blessed be Thou, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Thine, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heaven and in the
         earth is Thine; Thine is the kingdom, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and Thou art exalted as head above all. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Both riches and honour come of Thee, and Thou rulest over all; and in Thy hand is power and might; and in Thy hand it is to
         make great, and to give strength unto all. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Now therefore, our God, we thank Thee, and praise Thy glorious name. <span class="verse-number">14</span>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
         Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee. <span class="verse-number">15</span>For we are strangers before Thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there
         is no abiding. <span class="verse-number">16</span>O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, all this store that we have prepared to build Thee a house for Thy holy name cometh of Thy hand, and is all Thine
         own. <span class="verse-number">17</span>I know also, my God, that Thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart
         I have 
         willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy Thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto Thee.
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever, even the imagination of the thoughts of the
         heart of Thy people, and direct their heart unto Thee; <span class="verse-number">19</span>and give unto Solomon my son a whole heart, to keep Thy commandments, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to do all these
         things, and to build the palace, for which I have made, provision.’  <span class="verse-number">20</span>And David said to all the congregation: ‘Now bless the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.’ And all the congregation blessed the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and prostrated themselves before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and before the king. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and offered burnt-offerings unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings,
         and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel; <span class="verse-number">22</span>and did eat and drink before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. <span class="verse-number">23</span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel hearkened to him. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise 
         
         
         
         
         
         of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any
         king before him in Israel.  <span class="verse-number">26</span>Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years 
         reigned he in Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. <span class="verse-number">29</span>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the words of Samuel the seer, and in the words
         of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Gad the seer; <span class="verse-number">30</span>with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
