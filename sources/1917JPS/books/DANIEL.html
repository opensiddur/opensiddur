         <h3>
            									Chapter 1
         </h3>
         <span class="small-caps">In the</span> third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them
         into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure-house of his god. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz his chief officer, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, and of the
         seed royal, and of the nobles, <span class="verse-number">4</span>youths in whom was no blemish, but fair to look on, and skilful in all wisdom, and skilful in knowledge, and discerning in
         thought, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue
         of the Chaldeans. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s food, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be
         nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the chief of the officers gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach;
         and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank;
         therefore he requested of the chief of the officers that he might not defile himself. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And God granted Daniel mercy and compassion in the sight of the chief of the officers. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the chief of the officers said unto Daniel: ‘I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink; for
         why should he see your faces sad in comparison with the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with
         the king.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the chief of the officers had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>‘Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s food; and as
         thou seest, deal with thy servants.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and tried them ten days. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did
         eat of the king’s food. <span class="verse-number">16</span>So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>Now as for these four youths, God 
         
         
         
         
         gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the chief of the officers brought them in before
         Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood
         they before the king. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the
         magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 2
         </h3>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his
         sleep broke from him. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king
         his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the king said unto them: ‘I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic: ‘O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare
         the interpretation.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans: ‘The thing is certain with me; if ye make not known unto me the dream and the
         interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall 
         be made a dunghill. <span class="verse-number">6</span>But if ye declare the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; only
         declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>They answered the second time and said: ‘Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.’
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>The king answered and said: ‘I know of a truth that ye would gain time, inasmuch as ye see the thing is certain with me, <span class="verse-number">9</span>that, if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; and ye have agreed together to speak before me
         lying and corrupt words, till the time be changed; only tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can declare unto me the
         interpretation thereof.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: ‘There is not a man upon the earth that can declare the king’s matter; forasmuch
         as no great and powerful king hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And it is a hard thing that the king asketh, and there is none other that can declare it before the king, except the gods,
         whose dwelling is not with flesh.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. <span class="verse-number">13</span>So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and discretion to Arioch the 
         
         
         
         
         captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; <span class="verse-number">15</span>he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain: ‘Wherefore is the decree so peremptory from the king?’ Then Arioch made
         the thing known to Daniel. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, that he might declare unto the king the interpretation.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; <span class="verse-number">18</span>that they might ask mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with
         the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <span class="verse-number">19</span>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <span class="verse-number">20</span>Daniel spoke and said:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Blessed be the name of God  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>From everlasting even unto everlasting;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>For wisdom and might are His;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>And He changeth the times and the seasons;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>He removeth kings, and setteth up kings;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>He giveth wisdom unto the wise,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And knowledge to them that know understanding;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>He revealeth the deep and secret things;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>He knoweth what is in the darkness,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the light dwelleth with Him.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>I thank Thee, and praise Thee,  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>O Thou God of my fathers, w 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Who hast given me wisdom and might,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And hast now made known unto me what we desired of Thee;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>For Thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus
         unto him: ‘Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will declare unto the king the interpretation.’
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">25</span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: ‘I have found a man of the children of the
         captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.’ <span class="verse-number">26</span>The king spoke and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: ‘Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have
         seen, and the interpretation thereof?’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>Daniel answered before the king, and said: ‘The secret which the king hath asked can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians,
         nor astrologers, declare unto the king; <span class="verse-number">28</span>but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and He hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
         end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: <span class="verse-number">29</span>as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and He that revealeth
         secrets hath made known to thee what shall 
         
         
         
         
         come to pass. <span class="verse-number">30</span>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the
         interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">31</span>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was surpassing, stood before
         thee; and the appearance thereof was terrible. <span class="verse-number">32</span>As for that image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, <span class="verse-number">33</span>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. <span class="verse-number">34</span>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and
         broke them to pieces. <span class="verse-number">35</span>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of
         the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote
         the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. <span class="verse-number">36</span>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">37</span>Thou, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;
         <span class="verse-number">38</span>and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven dwell, hath He given them into thy
         hand, and hath made thee to rule 
         over them all; thou art the head of gold. <span class="verse-number">39</span>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over
         all the earth. <span class="verse-number">40</span>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and beateth down all things; and as iron
         that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush. <span class="verse-number">41</span>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there
         shall be in it of the firmness of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. <span class="verse-number">42</span>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part thereof
         broken. <span class="verse-number">43</span>And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by the seed of men; but they shall not
         cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay. <span class="verse-number">44</span>And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; nor shall the kingdom
         be left to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but it shall stand for ever. <span class="verse-number">45</span>Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the
         brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and
         the dream is certain, and the interpretation 
         
         
         
         
         thereof sure.’ <span class="verse-number">46</span>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and
         sweet odours unto him. <span class="verse-number">47</span>The king spoke unto Daniel, and said: ‘Of a truth it is, that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer
         of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.’ <span class="verse-number">48</span>Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and
         to be chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. <span class="verse-number">49</span>And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon;
         but Daniel was in the gate of the king.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div> 
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 3
         </h3>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits; he
         set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers,
         the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar
         the king had set up. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the
         rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that 
         Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the herald cried aloud: ‘To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, <span class="verse-number">5</span>that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down
         and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up; <span class="verse-number">6</span>and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and all kinds of music,
         all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had
         set up.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews. <span class="verse-number">9</span>They spoke and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: ‘O king, live for ever! <span class="verse-number">10</span>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and
         bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; <span class="verse-number">11</span>and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. <span class="verse-number">12</span>There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego;
         these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they 
         
         
         
         
         serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought
         before the king. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them: ‘Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my gods, nor worship
         the golden image which I have set up? <span class="verse-number">15</span>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds
         of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made , well; but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour
         into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands?’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this
         matter. <span class="verse-number">17</span>If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, He will deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and out of thy hand, O
         king. <span class="verse-number">18</span>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set
         up.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his visage was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego;
         he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And he commanded certain mighty men that 
         were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, and their robes, and their other garments, and were cast into the
         midst of the burning fiery furnace. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Therefore because the king’s commandment was peremptory, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men
         that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was alarmed, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his ministers: ‘Did not we cast three
         men bound into the midst of the fire?’ They answered and said unto the king: ‘True, O king.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>He answered and said: ‘Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance
         of the fourth is like a son of the gods.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said: ‘Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
         ye servants of God Most High, come forth, and come hither.’ Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth out of the midst
         of the fire. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king’s ministers, being gathered together, saw these men, that the
         fire had no power upon 
         
         
         
         
         their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their cloaks changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on
         them. <span class="verse-number">28</span>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said: ‘Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent His angel, and delivered
         His servants that trusted in Him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve
         nor worship any god, except their own God. <span class="verse-number">29</span>Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach,
         Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that
         is able to deliver after this sort.’ <span class="verse-number">30</span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.

         <span class="verse-number">31</span>‘Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; peace be multiplied unto

         of the dream.  <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they
         did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.  <span class="verse-number">5</span>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the

         thee trouble, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And behold a tree in the midst of the earth,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the height thereof was great.  <span class="verse-number">8</span>The tree grew, and was strong,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the height thereof reached unto heaven,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And in it was food for all;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The beasts of the field had shadow under it,  
         
         
         
         
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof,

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Let the beasts get away from under it,

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth,

         <span class="verse-number">15</span>This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise
         men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods
         is in thee.’   <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while, and his thoughts affrighted him. The king spoke and said:
         ‘Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, affright thee.’ Belteshazzar answered and said: ‘My lord, the dream
         be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries. <span class="verse-number">17</span>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all
         the earth; <span class="verse-number">18</span>whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
         and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation; <span class="verse-number">19</span>it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion
         to the end of the earth. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying: Hew down the tree, and destroy it;
         nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
         field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the 
         
         
         
         
         beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him—<span class="verse-number">21</span>this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king, <span class="verse-number">22</span>that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat
         grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most
         High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that
         thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by showing
         mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy prosperity.’  <span class="verse-number">25</span>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="verse-number">26</span>At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon. <span class="verse-number">27</span>The king spoke, and said: ‘Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power
         and for the glory of my majesty?’ <span class="verse-number">28</span>While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven: ‘O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: the
         kingdom is departed from thee. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass
         as 
         oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it
         to whomsoever He will.’ <span class="verse-number">30</span>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
         body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’feathers, and his nails like birds’claws.   <span class="verse-number">31</span>‘And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and
         I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured Him that liveth for ever;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>For His dominion is an everlasting dominion,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And His kingdom from generation to generation;

         unto me; and my ministers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and surpassing greatness was added
         unto me. <span class="verse-number">34</span>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and

         <h3>
            									Chapter 5
         </h3>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had
         taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his consorts and his concubines, might drink
         therein. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the
         king, and his lords, his consorts and his concubines, drank in them. <span class="verse-number">4</span>They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. <span class="verse-number">5</span>In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of
         the king’s palace; and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then the king’s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts affrighted him; and the joints of his loins were loosed,
         and his knees smote one against another. <span class="verse-number">7</span>The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king spoke and said to the wise men
         of Babylon: ‘Whosoever shall read this writing, and declare unto me the interpretation thereof, 
         shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall rule as one of three in the kingdom.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then was king Belshazzar greatly affrighted, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed. <span class="verse-number">10</span>Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house; the queen spoke and said: ‘O king,
         live for ever! let not thy thoughts affright thee, nor let thy countenance be changed; <span class="verse-number">11</span>there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding
         and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father,
         made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers; <span class="verse-number">12</span>forasmuch as a surpassing spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and declaring of riddles, and
         loosing of knots, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will declare
         the interpretation.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said unto Daniel: ‘Art thou Daniel, who is of the children
         of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? <span class="verse-number">14</span>I have heard of thee, that 
         
         
         
         
         the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and surpassing wisdom is found in thee. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto
         me the interpretation thereof; but they could not declare the interpretation of the thing. <span class="verse-number">16</span>But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and loose knots; now if thou canst read the writing, and make
         known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt
         rule as one of three in the kingdom.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>Then Daniel answered and said before the king: ‘Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless
         I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. <span class="verse-number">18</span>O thou king, God Most High gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty; <span class="verse-number">19</span>and because of the greatness that He gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom
         he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down. <span class="verse-number">20</span>But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne,
         and his glory was taken from him; <span class="verse-number">21</span>and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was 
         made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with
         the dew of heaven; until he knew that God Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that He setteth up over it whomsoever
         He will. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this; <span class="verse-number">23</span>but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before thee, and thou
         and thy lords, thy consorts and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold,
         of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are
         all thy ways, hast thou not glorified; <span class="verse-number">24</span>then was the palm of the hand sent from before Him, and this writing was inscribed. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN. <span class="verse-number">26</span>This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end. <span class="verse-number">27</span>TEKEL, Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. <span class="verse-number">28</span>PERES, thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation
         concerning him, that he should rule as one of three in the kingdom. <span class="verse-number">30</span>In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.  
         
         
         
         
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 6
         </h3>And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old. <span class="verse-number">2</span>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom; <span class="verse-number">3</span>and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king
         should have no damage.  <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the presidents and the satraps, because a surpassing spirit was in him; and the
         king thought to set him over the whole realm.   
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no
         occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.  <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then said these men: ‘We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him in the matter of the
         law of his God.’  <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then these presidents and satraps came tumultuously to the king, and said thus unto him: ‘King Darius, live for ever!  <span class="verse-number">8</span>All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the ministers and the governors, have consulted together
         that the king should establish a statute, and make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man
         for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.  <span class="verse-number">9</span>Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, 
         according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.’  <span class="verse-number">10</span>Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house—now his windows were open in his upper chamber toward
         Jerusalem—and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>Then these men came tumultuously, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s interdict: ‘Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every
         man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?’
         The king answered and said: ‘The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then answered they and said before the king: ‘That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not
         thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.’  <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he laboured
         till the going down of the sun to deliver him. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then these men came tumultuously unto the king, and said unto the king: ‘Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians,
         that no interdict nor statute 
         
         
         
         
         which the king establisheth may be changed.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel:
         ‘Thy God whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet
         of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were diversions brought before him; and his sleep
         fled from him.  <span class="verse-number">20</span>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a pained voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel: ‘O Daniel,
         servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then said Daniel unto the king: ‘O king, live for ever!  <span class="verse-number">23</span>My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions’mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Him innocency was
         found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out
         of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And the king commanded, 
         and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their
         wives; and they had not come to the bottom of the den, when the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in
         pieces.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: ‘Peace be multiplied unto
         you. <span class="verse-number">27</span>I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>For He is the living God,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And stedfast for ever,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And His dominion shall be even unto the end;

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>In heaven and in earth;

         </h3>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed; then he wrote the
         dream and told the sum of the matters. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea.
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>And four great beasts came up from 
         
         
         
         
         the sea, diverse one from another. <span class="verse-number">4</span>The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from
         the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth
         between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
         four heads; and dominion was given to it. <span class="verse-number">7</span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had
         great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the
         beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. <span class="verse-number">8</span>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first
         horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great
         things. <span class="verse-number">9</span>I beheld  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Till thrones were placed,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And one that was ancient of days did sit:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>His raiment was as white snow,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the hair of his head like pure wool;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>His throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>A fiery stream issued  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The judgment was set,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the books were opened.  <span class="verse-number">11</span>I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain,
         and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>I saw in the night visions,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>One like unto a son of man,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And he came even to the Ancient of days,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And he was brought near before Him.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>And there was given him dominion,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And glory, and a kingdom,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>That all the peoples, nations, and languages  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Should serve him;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me. 
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the
         interpretation of the things: <span class="verse-number">17</span>‘These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. <span class="verse-number">18</span>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose
         teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; <span class="verse-number">20</span>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that
         horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows. <span class="verse-number">21</span>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; <span class="verse-number">22</span>until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints
         possessed the kingdom. <span class="verse-number">23</span>Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall
         devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse
         from the former, and he shall put down three kings. 
         <span class="verse-number">25</span>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change
         the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. <span class="verse-number">26</span>But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of
         the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.’ <span class="verse-number">28</span>Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but
         I kept the matter in my heart.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 8
         </h3>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared
         unto me at the first. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the castle, which is in the province of Elam; and
         I saw in the vision, and I was by the stream Ulai. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns
         were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. <span class="verse-number">4</span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any
         that 
         
         
         
         
         could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground;
         and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at him in the fury of his power.
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns;
         and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there
         was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there
         came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward
         the beauteous land. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled
         upon them. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and from him the continual burnt-offering was taken away, and the
         place of his sanctuary was cast down. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the host was given over to it 
         together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it wrought, and
         prospered. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spoke: ‘How long shall be the vision
         concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that causes appalment, to give both the sanctuary and the host
         to be trampled under foot?’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he said unto me: ‘Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be victorious.’
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood
         before me as the appearance of a man. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, who called, and said: ‘Gabriel, make this man to understand the
         vision.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face; but he said unto me: ‘Understand,
         O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>And he said: ‘Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed
         time of the end. <span class="verse-number">20</span>The ram which thou sawest having the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And the 
         
         
         
         
         rough he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but
         not with his power. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have completed their transgression, there shall stand up a
         king of fierce countenance, and understanding stratagems. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do; and he
         shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And through his cunning he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in time
         of security shall he destroy many; he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true; but thou, shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth
         to many days to come.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was appalled at the vision,
         but understood it not.

            									Chapter 9
         </h3>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>in the first year of his reign I Daniel meditated in the books, over the number of the 
         years, whereof the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And I prayed unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, and made confession, and said: ‘O Lord, the great and awful God, who keepest covenant and mercy with them that love
         Thee and keep Thy commandments, <span class="verse-number">5</span>we have sinned, and have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments
         and from Thine ordinances; <span class="verse-number">6</span>neither have we hearkened unto Thy servants the prophets, that spoke in Thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers,
         and to all the people of the land. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the
         inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither Thou
         hast driven them, because they dealt treacherously with Thee. <span class="verse-number">8</span>O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against Thee.
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>To the Lord our God belong compassions and forgivenesses; for we have rebelled against Him; <span class="verse-number">10</span>neither have we hearkened to the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets. 
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Yea, all Israel have transgressed Thy law, and have turned aside, so as not to hearken to Thy voice; and so there hath been
         poured out upon us the curse and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against
         Him. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And He hath confirmed His word, which He spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great
         evil; so that under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">13</span>As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us; yet have we not entreated the favour of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in Thy truth. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And so the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God is righteous in all His works which He hath done, and we have not hearkened to His voice. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten Thee
         renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. <span class="verse-number">16</span>O Lord, according to all Thy righteousness, let Thine anger and Thy fury, I pray Thee, be turned away from Thy city Jerusalem,
         Thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are become a reproach
         to all that are about us. <span class="verse-number">17</span>Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplications, 
         and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake. <span class="verse-number">18</span>O my God, incline Thine ear, and hear; open Thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city upon which Thy name is called;
         for we do not present our supplications before Thee because of our righteousness, but because of Thy great compassions. <span class="verse-number">19</span>O Lord, hear, O Lord, forgive, O Lord, attend and do, defer not; for Thine own sake, O my God, because Thy name is called
         upon Thy city and Thy people.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">20</span>And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication
         before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God for the holy mountain of my God; <span class="verse-number">21</span>yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly
         swiftly, approached close to me about the time of the evening offering. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And he made me to understand, and talked with me, and said: ‘O Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding.
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>At the beginning of thy supplications a word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art greatly beloved; therefore
         look into the word, and understand the vision. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sin,
         and to forgive iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal vision and prophet, and to 
         
         
         
         
         anoint the most holy place. <span class="verse-number">25</span>Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto one anointed, a prince,
         shall be seven weeks; and for threescore and two weeks, it shall be built again, with broad place and moat, but in troublous
         times. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And after the threescore and two weeks shall an anointed one be cut off, and be no more; and the people of a prince that shall
         come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; but his end shall be with a flood; and unto the end of the war desolations
         are determined. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week; and for half of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering
         to cease; and upon the wing of detestable things shall be that which causeth appalment; and that until the extermination wholly
         determined be poured out upon that which causeth appalment.’

            									Chapter 10
         </h3>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word
         was true, even a great warfare; and he gave heed to the word, and had understanding of the vision. <span class="verse-number">2</span>In those days I Daniel was mourning three whole weeks. <span class="verse-number">3</span>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks
         were fulfilled. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris, <span class="verse-number">5</span>I lifted up mine eyes, 
         and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz; <span class="verse-number">6</span>his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms
         and his feet like in colour to burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; howbeit a great trembling fell upon them,
         and they fled to hide themselves. <span class="verse-number">8</span>So that I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in
         me into corruption, and I retained no strength. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face,
         with my face toward the ground. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me tottering upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And he said unto me: ‘O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, give heed unto the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright;
         for now am I sent unto thee’; and when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Then said he unto me: ‘Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble
         thyself before thy God, thy words were heard; and I am come because of thy words. <span class="verse-number">13</span>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, 
         
         
         
         
         one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I was left over there beside the kings of Persia. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the end of days; for there is yet a vision for the days.’
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>And when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said unto him
         that stood before me: ‘O my lord, by reason of the vision my pains are come upon me, and I retain no strength. <span class="verse-number">17</span>For how can this servant of my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither
         was there breath left in me.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And he said: ‘O man greatly beloved, fear not! peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong.’ And when he had spoken unto
         me, I was strengthened, and said: ‘Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>Then said he: Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when
         I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Howbeit I will declare unto thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth; and there is none that holdeth with me against
         these, except Michael your prince.

         of the north to make an agreement; but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm;
         but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begot her, and he that obtained her in those times.

         </h3>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be
         a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a 
         nation even to that same time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the
         book. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches and everlasting
         abhorrence. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn the many to righteousness as the
         stars for ever and ever. <span class="verse-number">4</span>But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
         shall be increased.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the bank of the river on this side, and the other on
         the bank of the river on that side. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river: ‘How long shall it be to the end of the wonders?’
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he lifted up his right hand and his left
         hand unto heaven, and swore by Him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have
         made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And I heard, but I understood not; then said I: ‘O my Lord, what shall be the latter end of these things?’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he said: ‘Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end. <span class="verse-number">10</span>Many shall purify 
         
         
         
         
         themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand;
         but they that are wise shall understand. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the detestable thing that causes appalment 
         set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Happy is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. <span class="verse-number">13</span>But go thou thy way till the end be; and thou shalt rest, and shalt stand up to thy lot, at the end of the days.’
