         <chapter-number>1</chapter-number>HAPPY IS the man that hath not  walked in the counsel of the  wicked,  <paragraph-break/>Nor stood in the way of sinners,  <paragraph-break/>Nor sat in the seat of the scornful. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>But his delight is in the law of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>And in His law doth he meditate day and night. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water,  <paragraph-break/>That bringeth forth its fruit in its season,  <paragraph-break/>And whose leaf doth not wither;  <paragraph-break/>And in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Not so the wicked;  <paragraph-break/>But they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,  <paragraph-break/>Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> regardeth the way of the righteous;  <paragraph-break/>But the way of the wicked shall perish. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>2</chapter-number>Why are the nations in an  uproar?  <paragraph-break/>And why do the peoples mutter in vain? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number> The kings of the earth stand up,  <paragraph-break/>And the rulers take counsel together,  <paragraph-break/>Against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and against His anointed: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number> 'Let us break their bands asunder,  <paragraph-break/>And cast away their cords from us.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number> He that sitteth in heaven laugheth,  <paragraph-break/>The Lord hath them in derision. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number> Then will He speak unto them in His wrath,  <paragraph-break/>And affright them in His sore displeasure: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number> 'Truly it is I that have established My king  <paragraph-break/>Upon Zion, My holy mountain.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number> I will tell of the decree:  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: 'Thou art My son,  <paragraph-break/>This day have I begotten thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number> Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for thine inheritance,  <paragraph-break/>And the ends of the earth for thy possession. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;  <paragraph-break/>Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.' 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number> Now therefore, O ye kings, be wise;  <paragraph-break/>Be admonished, ye judges of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Serve the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> with fear,  <paragraph-break/>And rejoice with trembling. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Do homage in purity, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way,  <paragraph-break/>When suddenly His wrath is kindled.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>Happy are all they that take refuge in Him. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>3</chapter-number>A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, how many are mine adversaries become!  <paragraph-break/>Many are they that rise up against me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Many there are that say of my soul:  <paragraph-break/>'There is no salvation for him in God.'                                     Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>But thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, art a shield about me;  <paragraph-break/>My glory, and the lifter up of my head. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>With my voice I call unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And He answereth me out of His holy mountain.                   Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>I lay me down, and I sleep;  <paragraph-break/>I awake, for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> sustaineth me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>I am not afraid of ten thousands of people,  
         <paragraph-break/>That have set themselves against me round about. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Arise, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; save me, O my God;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek,  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Salvation belongeth unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Thy blessing be upon Thy people.  Selah <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>4</chapter-number>For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>Thou who didst set me free when I was in distress;  <paragraph-break/>Be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame,  <paragraph-break/>In that ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?                            Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>But know that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath set apart the godly man as His own;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will hear when I call unto Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Tremble, and sin not;  <paragraph-break/>Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And put your trust in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Many there are that say: 'Oh that we could see some good!'  <paragraph-break/>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou hast put gladness in my heart,  <paragraph-break/>More than when their corn and their wine increase. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, makest me dwell alone in safety. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>5</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Give ear to my words, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, consider my meditation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God;  <paragraph-break/>For unto Thee do I pray. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice;  <paragraph-break/>In the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness;  <paragraph-break/>Evil shall not sojourn with Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house;  
         <paragraph-break/>I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me;  <paragraph-break/>Make Thy way straight before my face. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For there is no sincerity in their mouth;  <paragraph-break/>Their inward part is a yawning gulf,  <paragraph-break/>Their throat is an open sepulchre;  <paragraph-break/>They make smooth their tongue. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Hold them guilty, O God,  <paragraph-break/>Let them fall by their own counsels;  <paragraph-break/>Cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions;  <paragraph-break/>For they have rebelled against Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice,  <paragraph-break/>They shall ever shout for joy,  <paragraph-break/>And Thou shalt shelter them;  <paragraph-break/>Let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For Thou dost bless the righteous;  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>6</chapter-number>For the Leader; with string-music; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, rebuke me not in Thine anger,  <paragraph-break/>Neither chasten me in Thy wrath. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Be gracious unto me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for I languish away;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Heal me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for my bones are affrighted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>My soul also is sore affrighted;  <paragraph-break/>And Thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, how long? <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Return, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, deliver my soul;  <paragraph-break/>Save me for Thy mercy's sake. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>For in death there is no remembrance of Thee;  <paragraph-break/>In the nether-world who will give Thee thanks? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>I am weary with my groaning;  <paragraph-break/>Every night make I my bed to swim;  <paragraph-break/>I melt away my couch with my tears. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Mine eye is dimmed because of vexation;  <paragraph-break/>It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;  <paragraph-break/>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath heard the voice of my weeping. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath heard my supplication;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> receiveth my prayer. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore affrighted;  <paragraph-break/>They shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>7</chapter-number>Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, concerning Cush a Benjamite.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God, in Thee have I taken refuge;  
         <paragraph-break/>Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Lest he tear my soul like a lion,  <paragraph-break/>Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God, if I have done this;  <paragraph-break/>If there be iniquity in my hands; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>If I have requited him that did evil unto me,  <paragraph-break/>Or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it,  <paragraph-break/>And tread my life down to the earth;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, let him lay my glory in the dust.                                      Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Arise, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in Thine anger,  <paragraph-break/>Lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about,  <paragraph-break/>And over them return Thou on high. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, who ministerest judgment to the peoples,  <paragraph-break/>Judge me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>According to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked,  <paragraph-break/>And that Thou wouldest establish the righteous;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>For the righteous God trieth the heart and reins. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>My shield is with God,  <paragraph-break/>Who saveth the upright in heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>God is a righteous judge,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, a God that hath indignation every day: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>If a man turn not, He will whet His sword,  <paragraph-break/>He hath bent His bow, and made it ready; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, His arrows which He made sharp. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Behold, he travaileth with iniquity;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it,  <paragraph-break/>And is fallen into the ditch which he made. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>His mischief shall return upon his own head,  <paragraph-break/>And his violence shall come down upon his own pate. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>I will give thanks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> according to His righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>And will sing praise to the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> Most High. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>8</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, our Lord,  <paragraph-break/>How glorious is Thy name in all the earth!  
         <paragraph-break/>Whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou founded strength,  <paragraph-break/>Because of Thine adversaries;  <paragraph-break/>That Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>When I behold Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers,  <paragraph-break/>The moon and the stars, which Thou hast established; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?  <paragraph-break/>And the son of man, that Thou thinkest of him? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels,  <paragraph-break/>And hast crowned him with glory and honour. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast put all things under His feet: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Sheep and oxen, all of them,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, and the beasts of the field;  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea;  <paragraph-break/>Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, our Lord,  <paragraph-break/>How glorious is Thy name in all the earth! <paragraph-break/> For the Leader; upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will give thanks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> with my whole heart;  <paragraph-break/>I will tell of all Thy marvellous works. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>I will be glad and exult in Thee;  <paragraph-break/>I will sing praise to Thy name, O Most High: <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>When mine enemies are turned back,  <paragraph-break/>They stumble and perish at Thy presence; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause;  <paragraph-break/>Thou sattest upon the throne as the righteous Judge. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thou hast rebuked the nations,  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast destroyed the wicked,  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>O thou enemy, the waste places are come to an end for ever;  <paragraph-break/>And the cities which thou didst uproot,  <paragraph-break/>Their very memorial is perished. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is enthroned for ever;  <paragraph-break/>He hath established His throne for judgment. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>And He will judge the world in righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>He will minister judgment to the peoples with equity. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> also will be a high tower for the oppressed,  <paragraph-break/>A high tower in times of trouble; 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee;  <paragraph-break/>For thou, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Sing praises to the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, who dwelleth in Zion;  <paragraph-break/>Declare among the peoples His doings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For He that avengeth blood hath remembered them;  <paragraph-break/>He hath not forgotten the cry of the humble. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Be gracious unto me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Behold mine affliction at the hands of them that hate me;  <paragraph-break/>Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>That I may tell of all Thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion,  <paragraph-break/>That I may rejoice in Thy salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made;  <paragraph-break/>In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath made Himself known, He hath executed judgment,  <paragraph-break/>The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.     Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>The wicked shall return to the nether-world,  <paragraph-break/>Even all the nations that forget God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>For the needy shall not alway be forgotten,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Arise, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, let not man prevail;  <paragraph-break/>Let the nations be judged in Thy sight. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Set terror over them, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Let the nations know they are but men.                                      Selah <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>10</chapter-number>Why standest Thou afar off,  O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>?  <paragraph-break/>Why hidest Thou Thyself in times of trouble? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Through the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued,  <paragraph-break/>They are taken in the devices that they have imagined. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,  <paragraph-break/>And the covetous vaunteth himself, though he contemn the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require';  <paragraph-break/>All his thoughts are: 'There is no God.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>His ways prosper at all times;  <paragraph-break/>Thy judgments are far above out of his sight;  <paragraph-break/>As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>He saith in his heart: 'I shall not be moved,  <paragraph-break/>I who to all generations shall not be in adversity.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression;  
         <paragraph-break/>Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages;  <paragraph-break/>In secret places doth he slay the innocent;  <paragraph-break/>His eyes are on the watch for the helpless. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>He lieth in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair,  <paragraph-break/>He lieth in wait to catch the poor;  <paragraph-break/>He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him up in his net. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>He croucheth, he boweth down,  <paragraph-break/>And the helpless fall into his mighty claws. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>He hath said in his heart: 'God hath forgotten;  <paragraph-break/>He hideth His face; He will never see.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Arise, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; O God, lift up Thy hand;  <paragraph-break/>Forget not the humble. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God,  <paragraph-break/>And say in his heart: 'Thou wilt not require'? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Thou hast seen; for Thou beholdest trouble and vexation, to requite them with Thy hand;  <paragraph-break/>Unto Thee the helpless committeth himself;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Break Thou the arm of the wicked;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And as for the evil man, search out his wickedness, till none be found. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is King for ever and ever;  <paragraph-break/>The nations are perished out of His land. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou hast heard the desire of the humble:  <paragraph-break/>Thou wilt direct their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to attend; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>To right the fatherless and the oppressed,  <paragraph-break/>That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>11</chapter-number>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>In the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> have I taken refuge;  <paragraph-break/>How say ye to my soul:  <paragraph-break/>'Flee thou! to your mountain, ye birds'? <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>For, lo, the wicked bend the bow,  <paragraph-break/>They have made ready their arrow upon the string,  <paragraph-break/>That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>When the foundations are destroyed,  <paragraph-break/>What hath the righteous wrought? <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is in His holy temple,  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, His throne is in heaven;  <paragraph-break/>His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> trieth the righteous;  
         <paragraph-break/>But the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Upon the wicked He will cause to rain coals;  <paragraph-break/>Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is righteous, He loveth righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>The upright shall behold His face. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>12</chapter-number>For the Leader; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Help, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; for the godly man ceaseth;  <paragraph-break/>For the faithful fail from among the children of men. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour;  <paragraph-break/>With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>May the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> cut off all flattering lips,  <paragraph-break/>The tongue that speaketh proud things! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Who have said: 'Our tongue will we make mighty;  <paragraph-break/>Our lips are with us: who is lord over us?' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>'For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,  <paragraph-break/>Now will I arise', saith the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>'I will set him in safety at whom they puff.' <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>The words of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> are pure words,  <paragraph-break/>As silver tried in a crucible on the earth, refined seven times. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou wilt keep them, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Thou wilt preserve us from this generation for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>The wicked walk on every side,  <paragraph-break/>When vileness is exalted among the sons of men. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>13</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>How long, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, wilt Thou forget me for ever?  <paragraph-break/>How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day?  <paragraph-break/>How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Behold Thou, and answer me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God;  <paragraph-break/>Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Lest mine enemy say: 'I have prevailed against him';  <paragraph-break/>Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust;  <paragraph-break/>My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>I will sing unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  
         <paragraph-break/>Because He hath dealt bountifully with me. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>14</chapter-number>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God';  <paragraph-break/>They have dealt corruptly, they have done abominably;  <paragraph-break/>There is none that doeth good. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> looked forth from heaven upon the children of men,  <paragraph-break/>To see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>They are all corrupt, they are together become impure;  <paragraph-break/>There is none that doeth good, no, not one. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>‘Shall not all the workers of iniquity know it,  <paragraph-break/>Who eat up My people as they eat bread,  <paragraph-break/>And call not upon the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>There are they in great fear;  <paragraph-break/>For God is with the righteous generation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor,  <paragraph-break/>But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is his refuge. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!  <paragraph-break/>When the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> turneth the captivity of His people,  <paragraph-break/>Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <chapter-number>15</chapter-number>A Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle?  <paragraph-break/>Who shall dwell upon Thy holy mountain? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And speaketh truth in his heart; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>That hath no slander upon his tongue,  <paragraph-break/>Nor doeth evil to his fellow,  <paragraph-break/>Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>In whose eyes a vile person is despised,  <paragraph-break/>But he honoureth them that fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>He that putteth not out his money on interest,  <paragraph-break/>Nor taketh a bribe against the innocent.  <paragraph-break/>He that doeth these things shall never be moved. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>16</chapter-number>Michtam of David.   <paragraph-break/>Keep me, O God; for I have taken refuge in Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I have said unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>: 'Thou art my Lord;  <paragraph-break/>I have no good but in Thee'; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>As for the holy that are in the earth,  <paragraph-break/>They are the excellent in whom is all my delight. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Let the idols of them be multiplied that make suit unto another;  
         <paragraph-break/>Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer,  <paragraph-break/>Nor take their names upon my lips. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup,  <paragraph-break/>Thou maintainest my lot. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, I have a goodly heritage. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>I will bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, who hath given me counsel;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>I have set the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> always before me;  <paragraph-break/>Surely He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether-world;  <paragraph-break/>Neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly one to see the pit. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Thou makest me to know the path of life;  <paragraph-break/>In Thy presence is fulness of joy,  <paragraph-break/>In Thy right hand bliss for evermore. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>17</chapter-number>A Prayer of David.   <paragraph-break/>Hear the right, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, attend unto my cry;  <paragraph-break/>Give ear unto my prayer from lips without deceit. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Let Thine eyes behold equity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast visited it in the night;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast tested me, and Thou findest not  <paragraph-break/>That I had a thought which should not pass my mouth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>As for the doings of men, by the word of Thy lips  <paragraph-break/>I have kept me from the ways of the violent. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>My steps have held fast to Thy paths,  <paragraph-break/>My feet have not slipped. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>As for me, I call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God;  <paragraph-break/>Incline Thine ear unto me, hear my speech. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Make passing great Thy mercies, O Thou that savest by Thy right hand  <paragraph-break/>From assailants them that take refuge in Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Keep me as the apple of the eye,  <paragraph-break/>Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>From the wicked that oppress,  <paragraph-break/>My deadly enemies, that compass me about. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Their gross heart they have shut tight,  <paragraph-break/>With their mouth they speak proudly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>At our every step they have now encompassed us;  <paragraph-break/>They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces,  <paragraph-break/>And like a young lion lurking in secret places. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Arise, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, confront him, cast him down;  <paragraph-break/>Deliver my soul from the wicked, by Thy sword; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>From men, by Thy hand, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>From men of the world, whose portion is in this life,  <paragraph-break/>And whose belly Thou fillest with Thy treasure;  <paragraph-break/>Who have children in plenty,  <paragraph-break/>And leave their abundance to their babes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>18</chapter-number>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, who spoke unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> the words of this song in the day that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul; <verse-number>2</verse-number>And he said:  <paragraph-break/>I love thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, my strength. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;  <paragraph-break/>My God, my rock, in Him I take refuge;  <paragraph-break/>My shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Praised, I cry, is the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And I am saved from mine enemies. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>The cords of Death compassed me,  <paragraph-break/>And the floods of <note mark="a" id="note-946-a"> That is, <other-text font="Times New Roman,Italic" size="10.046" y="36.399">the nether-world.</other-text> 
         </note>Belial assailed me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The cords of <note mark="a" id="note-946-a"> That is, <other-text font="Times New Roman,Italic" size="10.046" y="36.399">the nether-world.</other-text> 
         </note>Sheol surrounded me;  <paragraph-break/>The snares of Death confronted me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>In my distress I called upon the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And cried unto my God;  <paragraph-break/>Out of His temple He heard my voice,  <paragraph-break/>And my cry came before Him unto His ears. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Then the earth did shake and quake,  <paragraph-break/>The foundations also of the mountains did tremble;  <paragraph-break/>They were shaken, because He was wroth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Smoke arose up in His nostrils,  <paragraph-break/>And fire out of His mouth did devour;  <paragraph-break/>Coals flamed forth from Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>He bowed the heavens also, and came down;  <paragraph-break/>And thick darkness was under His feet. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>He made darkness His hiding-place, His pavilion round about Him;  <paragraph-break/>Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>At the brightness before Him, there passed through His thick clouds  <paragraph-break/>Hailstones and coals of fire. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> also thundered in the heavens,  <paragraph-break/>And the Most High gave forth His voice;  <paragraph-break/>Hailstones and coals of fire. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them;  <paragraph-break/>And He shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the channels of waters appeared,  <paragraph-break/>And the foundations of the world were laid bare,  <paragraph-break/>At Thy rebuke, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>At the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>He sent from on high, He took me;  <paragraph-break/>He drew me out of many waters. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>He delivered me from mine enemy  <paragraph-break/> most strong,  <paragraph-break/>And from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>They confronted me in the day of my calamity;  <paragraph-break/>But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was a stay unto me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>He brought me forth also into a large place;  <paragraph-break/>He delivered me, because He delighted in me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> rewarded me according to my righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>According to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>For I have kept the ways of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And have not wickedly departed from my God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>For all His ordinances were before me,  <paragraph-break/>And I put not away His statutes from me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And I was single-hearted with Him,  <paragraph-break/>And I kept myself from mine iniquity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Therefore hath the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> recompensed me according to my righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>According to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful,  <paragraph-break/>With the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure;  <paragraph-break/>And with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>For Thou dost save the afflicted people;  <paragraph-break/>But the haughty eyes Thou dost humble. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>For Thou dost light my lamp;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God doth lighten my darkness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>For by Thee I run upon a troop;  <paragraph-break/>And by my God do I scale a wall. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>As for God, His way is perfect;  <paragraph-break/>The word of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is tried;  <paragraph-break/>He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>For who is God, save the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>?  <paragraph-break/>And who is a Rock, except our God? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>The God that girdeth me with strength,  <paragraph-break/>And maketh my way straight; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>Who maketh my feet like hinds',  <paragraph-break/>And setteth me upon my high places; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>Who traineth my hands for war,  <paragraph-break/>So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy right hand hath holden me up;  <paragraph-break/>And Thy condescension hath made me great. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,  <paragraph-break/>And my feet have not slipped. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>38</verse-number>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them;  <paragraph-break/>Neither did I turn back till they were consumed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>I have smitten them through, so that they are not able to rise;  <paragraph-break/>They are fallen under my feet. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>40</verse-number>For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>41</verse-number>Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,  <paragraph-break/>And I did cut off them that hate me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>42</verse-number>They cried, but there was none to save;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Even unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, but He answered them not. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>43</verse-number>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind;  <paragraph-break/>I did cast them out as the mire of the streets. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>44</verse-number>Thou hast delivered me from the contentions of the people;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast made me the head of the nations;  <paragraph-break/>A people whom I have not known serve me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>45</verse-number>As soon as they hear of me, they obey me;  <paragraph-break/>The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>46</verse-number>The sons of the stranger fade away,  <paragraph-break/>And come trembling out of their close places. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>47</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> liveth, and blessed be my Rock;  <paragraph-break/>And exalted be the God of my salvation; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>48</verse-number>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,  <paragraph-break/>And subdueth peoples under me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>49</verse-number>He delivereth me from mine enemies;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;  <paragraph-break/>Thou deliverest me from the violent man. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>50</verse-number>Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, among the nations,  <paragraph-break/>And will sing praises unto Thy name. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>51</verse-number>Great salvation giveth He to His king;  <paragraph-break/>And showeth mercy to His anointed,  <paragraph-break/>To David and to his seed, for evermore. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The heavens declare the glory of God,  <paragraph-break/>And the firmament showeth His handiwork; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Day unto day uttereth speech,  <paragraph-break/>And night unto night revealeth knowledge; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>There is no speech, there are no words,  <paragraph-break/>Neither is their voice heard. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Their line is gone out through all the earth,  <paragraph-break/>And their words to the end of the world.  <paragraph-break/>In them hath He set a tent for the sun, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,  <paragraph-break/>And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>His going forth is from the end of the heaven,  <paragraph-break/>And his circuit unto the ends of it;  <paragraph-break/>And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The law of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is perfect, restoring the soul;  <paragraph-break/>The testimony of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is sure, making wise the simple. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>The precepts of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> are right, rejoicing the heart;  <paragraph-break/>The commandment of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is pure, enlightening the eyes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The fear of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is clean, enduring for ever;  <paragraph-break/>The ordinances of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> are true, they are righteous altogether; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;  <paragraph-break/>Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Moreover by them is Thy servant warned;  <paragraph-break/>In keeping of them there is great reward. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Who can discern his errors?  <paragraph-break/>Clear Thou me from hidden faults. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins,  <paragraph-break/>That they may not have dominion over me; then shall I be faultless,  <paragraph-break/>And I shall be clear from great transgression. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee,  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, my Rock, and my Redeemer. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>20</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> answer thee in the day of trouble;  <paragraph-break/>The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Send forth thy help from the sanctuary,  
         <paragraph-break/>And support thee out of Zion; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Receive the memorial of all thy meal-offerings,  <paragraph-break/>And accept the fat of thy burnt-sacrifice;                               Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Grant thee according to thine own heart,  <paragraph-break/>And fulfil all thy counsel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>We will shout for joy in thy victory,  <paragraph-break/>And in the name of our God we will set up our standards;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> fulfil all thy petitions. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Now know I that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> saveth His anointed;  <paragraph-break/>He will answer him from His holy heaven  <paragraph-break/>With the mighty acts of His saving right hand. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses;  <paragraph-break/>But we will make mention of the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>They are bowed down and fallen;  <paragraph-break/>But we are risen, and stand upright. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Save, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Let the King answer us in the day that we call. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>21</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in Thy strength the king rejoiceth;  <paragraph-break/>And in Thy salvation how greatly doth he exult! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou hast given him his heart's desire,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And the request of his lips Thou hast not withholden.             Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For Thou meetest him with choicest blessings;  <paragraph-break/>Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>He asked life of Thee, Thou gavest it him;  <paragraph-break/>Even length of days for ever and ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>His glory is great through Thy salvation;  <paragraph-break/>Honour and majesty dost Thou lay upon him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For Thou makest him most blessed for ever;  <paragraph-break/>Thou makest him glad with joy in Thy presence. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>For the king trusteth in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, in the mercy of the Most High; he shall not be moved. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies;  <paragraph-break/>Thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall swallow them up in His wrath,  <paragraph-break/>And the fire shall devour them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth,  <paragraph-break/>And their seed from among the children of men. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>For they intended evil against thee,  <paragraph-break/>They imagined a device, wherewith they shall not prevail. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For thou shalt make them turn their back,  <paragraph-break/>Thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Be Thou exalted, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in Thy strength;  <paragraph-break/>So will we sing and praise Thy power. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>22</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon Aijeleth ha-Shahar. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me,  <paragraph-break/>And art far from my help at the words of my cry? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>O my God, I call by day, but Thou answerest not;  <paragraph-break/>And at night, and there is no surcease for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Yet Thou art holy,  <paragraph-break/>O Thou that art enthroned upon the praises of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>In Thee did our fathers trust;  <paragraph-break/>They trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Unto Thee they cried, and escaped;  <paragraph-break/>In Thee did they trust, and were not ashamed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>But I am a worm, and no man;  <paragraph-break/>A reproach of men, and despised of the people. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>All they that see me laugh me to scorn;  <paragraph-break/>They shoot out the lip, they shake the head: 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>'Let him commit himself unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>! let Him rescue him;  <paragraph-break/>Let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For Thou art He that took me out of the womb;  <paragraph-break/>Thou madest me trust when I was upon my mother's breasts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Upon Thee I have been cast from my birth;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art my God from my mother's womb. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Be not far from me; for trouble is near;  <paragraph-break/>For there is none to help. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Many bulls have encompassed me;  <paragraph-break/>Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>They open wide their mouth against me,  <paragraph-break/>As a ravening and a roaring lion. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>I am poured out like water,  <paragraph-break/>And all my bones are out of joint;  <paragraph-break/>My heart is become like wax;  <paragraph-break/>It is melted in mine inmost parts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>My strength is dried up like a potsherd;  <paragraph-break/>And my tongue cleaveth to my throat;  <paragraph-break/>And Thou layest me in the dust of death. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>For dogs have encompassed me;  <paragraph-break/>A company of evil-doers have inclosed me;  <paragraph-break/>Like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>I may count all my bones;  <paragraph-break/>They look and gloat over me. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>They part my garments among them,  <paragraph-break/>And for my vesture do they cast lots. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>But Thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, be not far off;  <paragraph-break/>O Thou my strength, hasten to help me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Deliver my soul from the sword;  <paragraph-break/>Mine only one from the power of the dog. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Save me from the lion's mouth;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen do Thou answer me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>I will declare Thy name unto my brethren;  <paragraph-break/>In the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>'Ye that fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, praise Him;  <paragraph-break/>All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him;  <paragraph-break/>And stand in awe of Him, all ye the seed of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>For He hath not despised nor abhorred the lowliness of the poor;  <paragraph-break/>Neither hath He hid His face from him;  <paragraph-break/>But when he cried unto Him, He heard.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>From Thee cometh my praise in the great congregation;  <paragraph-break/>I will pay my vows before them that fear Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>Let the humble eat and be satisfied;  <paragraph-break/>Let them praise the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> that seek after Him;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>May your heart be quickened for ever! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>For the kingdom is the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>And He is the ruler over the nations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship;  <paragraph-break/>All they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him,  <paragraph-break/>Even he that cannot keep his soul alive. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>A seed shall serve him;  <paragraph-break/>It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>They shall come and shall declare His righteousness  <paragraph-break/>Unto a people that shall be born, that He hath done it. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>23</chapter-number>A Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is my shepherd; I shall not want. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;  <paragraph-break/>He leadeth me beside the still waters. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>He restoreth my soul;  <paragraph-break/>He guideth me in straight paths for His name's sake. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  <paragraph-break/>I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me;  <paragraph-break/>Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;  <paragraph-break/>And I shall dwell in the house of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for ever. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>24</chapter-number>A Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>The earth is the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps>, and the fulness thereof;  <paragraph-break/>The world, and they that dwell therein. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>For He hath founded it upon the seas,  <paragraph-break/>And established it upon the floods. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Who shall ascend into the mountain of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>?  <paragraph-break/>And who shall stand in His holy place? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;  <paragraph-break/>Who hath not taken My name in vain,  <paragraph-break/>And hath not sworn deceitfully. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>He shall receive a blessing from the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And righteousness from the God of his salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Such is the generation of them that seek after Him,  <paragraph-break/>That seek Thy face, even Jacob.  <paragraph-break/>                                            Selah <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>26</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of David.   <paragraph-break/>Judge me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for I have walked in mine integrity,  <paragraph-break/>And I have trusted in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> without wavering. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Examine me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and try me;  <paragraph-break/>Test my reins and my heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For Thy mercy is before mine eyes;  <paragraph-break/>And I have walked in Thy truth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>I have not sat with men of falsehood;  <paragraph-break/>Neither will I go in with dissemblers. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I hate the gathering of evil doers,  <paragraph-break/>And will not sit with the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>I will wash my hands in innocency;  <paragraph-break/>So will I compass Thine altar, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,  <paragraph-break/>And tell of all Thy wondrous works. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, I love the habitation of Thy house,  <paragraph-break/>And the place where Thy glory dwelleth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Gather not my soul with sinners,  <paragraph-break/>Nor my life with men of blood; 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>In whose hands is craftiness,  <paragraph-break/>And their right hand is full of bribes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity;  <paragraph-break/>Redeem me, and be gracious unto me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>My foot standeth in an even place;  <paragraph-break/>In the congregations will I bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>27</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of David.   <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh,  <paragraph-break/>Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Though a host should encamp against me,  <paragraph-break/>My heart shall not fear;  <paragraph-break/>Though war should rise up against me,  <paragraph-break/>Even then will I be confident. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>One thing have I asked of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, that will I seek after:  <paragraph-break/>That I may dwell in the house of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> all the days of my life,  <paragraph-break/>To behold the graciousness of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and to visit early in His temple. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For He concealeth me in His pavilion in the day of evil;  <paragraph-break/>He hideth me in the covert of His tent;  <paragraph-break/>He lifteth me up upon a rock. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me;  <paragraph-break/>And I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices with trumpet-sound;  <paragraph-break/>I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Hear, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, when I call with my voice,  <paragraph-break/>And be gracious unto me, and answer me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>In Thy behalf my heart hath said: ‘Seek ye My face';  <paragraph-break/>Thy face, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, will I seek. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Hide not Thy face far from me;  <paragraph-break/>Put not Thy servant away in anger;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast been my help;  <paragraph-break/>Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For though my father and my mother have forsaken me,  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will take me up. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Teach me Thy way, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>And lead me in an even path,  <paragraph-break/>Because of them that lie in wait for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries;  <paragraph-break/>For false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>In the land of the living!— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Wait on the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Be strong, and let thy heart take courage;  
         <paragraph-break/>Yea, wait thou for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>28</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of David.   <paragraph-break/>Unto thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, do I call;  <paragraph-break/>My Rock, be not Thou deaf unto me;  <paragraph-break/>Lest, if Thou be silent unto me,  <paragraph-break/>I become like them that go down into the pit. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee,  <paragraph-break/>When I lift up my hands toward Thy holy Sanctuary. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Draw me not away with the wicked,  <paragraph-break/>And with the workers of iniquity;  <paragraph-break/>Who speak peace with their neighbours,  <paragraph-break/>But evil is in their hearts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Give them according to their deeds, and according to the evil of their endeavours;  <paragraph-break/>Give them after the work of their hands;  <paragraph-break/>Render to them their desert. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Because they give no heed to the works of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Nor to the operation of His hands;  <paragraph-break/>He will break them down and not build them up. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Blessed be the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Because He hath heard the voice of my supplications. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is my strength and my shield,  <paragraph-break/>In Him hath my heart trusted,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And I am helped;  <paragraph-break/>Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth,  <paragraph-break/>And with my song will I praise Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is a strength unto them;  <paragraph-break/>And He is a stronghold of salvation to His anointed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance;  <paragraph-break/>And tend them, and carry them for ever. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>29</chapter-number>A Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>Ascribe unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O ye sons of might,  <paragraph-break/>Ascribe unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> glory and strength. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Ascribe unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> the glory due unto His name;  <paragraph-break/>Worship the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in the beauty of holiness. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is upon the waters;  <paragraph-break/>The God of glory thundereth,  <paragraph-break/>Even the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> upon many waters. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is powerful;  <paragraph-break/>The voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is full of majesty. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>The voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> breaketh the cedars; yea, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>He maketh them also to skip like a calf;  <paragraph-break/>Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>The voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> heweth out flames of fire. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shaketh the wilderness;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>The voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> maketh the hinds to calve,  <paragraph-break/>And strippeth the forests bare;  <paragraph-break/>And in His temple all say: 'Glory.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> sat enthroned at the flood;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> sitteth as King for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will give strength unto His people;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will bless his people with peace. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>30</chapter-number>A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will extol thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for Thou hast raised me up,  <paragraph-break/>And hast not suffered mine enemies to rejoice over me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God,  <paragraph-break/>I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst heal me; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou broughtest up my soul from the nether-world;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Sing praise unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O ye His godly ones,  <paragraph-break/>And give thanks to His holy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>For His anger is but for a moment,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>His favour is for a life-time;  <paragraph-break/>Weeping may tarry for the night,  <paragraph-break/>But joy cometh in the morning. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Now I had said in my security: '  <paragraph-break/>I shall never be moved.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou hadst established, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in Thy favour my mountain as a stronghold— <paragraph-break/>Thou didst hide Thy face; I was affrighted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Unto Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, did I call,  <paragraph-break/>And unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> I made supplication: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>'What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?  <paragraph-break/>Shall the dust praise Thee? shall it declare Thy truth? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Hear, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and be gracious unto me;  <paragraph-break/>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, be Thou my helper.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>So that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent;  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>31</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>In thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed;  <paragraph-break/>Deliver me in Thy righteousness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Incline Thine ear unto me, deliver me speedily;  
         <paragraph-break/>Be Thou to me a rock of refuge, even a fortress of defence, to save me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For Thou art my rock and my fortress;  <paragraph-break/>Therefore for Thy name's sake lead me and guide me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Bring me forth out of the net that they have hidden for me;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou art my stronghold. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Into Thy hand I commit my spirit;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast redeemed me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou God of truth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>I hate them that regard lying vanities;  <paragraph-break/>But I trust in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>I will be glad and rejoice in Thy lovingkindness;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou hast seen mine affliction,  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast taken cognizance of the troubles of my soul, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>And Thou hast not given me over into the hand of the enemy;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast set my feet in a broad place. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Be gracious unto me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for I am in distress;  <paragraph-break/>Mine eye wasteth away with vexation, yea, my soul and my body. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>For my life is spent in sorrow, and my years in sighing;  <paragraph-break/>My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted away. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Yea, unto my neighbours exceedingly, and a dread to mine acquaintance;  <paragraph-break/>They that see me without flee from me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind;  <paragraph-break/>I am like a useless vessel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>For I have heard the whispering of many,  <paragraph-break/>Terror on every side;  <paragraph-break/>While they took counsel together against me,  <paragraph-break/>They devised to take away my life. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>But as for me, I have trusted in Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>I have said: 'Thou art my God.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>My times are in Thy hand;  <paragraph-break/>Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant;  <paragraph-break/>Save me in Thy lovingkindness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon Thee;  <paragraph-break/>Let the wicked be ashamed, let them be put to silence in the nether-world. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Let the lying lips be dumb,  <paragraph-break/>Which speak arrogantly against the righteous,  <paragraph-break/>With pride and contempt. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Oh how abundant is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee;  
         <paragraph-break/>Which Thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee, in the sight of the sons of men! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Thou hidest them in the covert of Thy presence from the plottings of man;  <paragraph-break/>Thou concealest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Blessed be the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>For He hath shown me His wondrous lovingkindness in an entrenched city. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>As for me, I said in my haste: 'I am cut off from before Thine eyes';  <paragraph-break/>Nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>O love the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all ye His godly ones;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> preserveth the faithful,  <paragraph-break/>And plentifully repayeth him that acteth haughtily. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Be strong, and let your heart take courage,  <paragraph-break/>All ye that wait for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>32</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of David. Maschil.   <paragraph-break/>Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Happy is the man unto whom the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> counteth not iniquity,  <paragraph-break/>And in whose spirit there is no guile.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>When I kept silence, my bones wore away  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Through my groaning all the day long. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me;  <paragraph-break/>My sap was turned as in the droughts of summer.            Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid;  <paragraph-break/>I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>' — <paragraph-break/>And Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.                Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found;  <paragraph-break/>Surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary;  <paragraph-break/>With songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about.               Selah  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go;  <paragraph-break/>I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding;  <paragraph-break/>Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,  <paragraph-break/>That they come not near unto thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Many are the sorrows of the wicked;  
         <paragraph-break/>But he that trusteth in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, mercy compasseth him about. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Be glad in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and rejoice, ye righteous;  <paragraph-break/>And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>33</chapter-number>Rejoice in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O ye  righteous,  <paragraph-break/>Praise is comely for the upright. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Give thanks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> with harp,  <paragraph-break/>Sing praises unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Sing unto Him a new song;  <paragraph-break/>Play skilfully amid shouts of joy. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For the word of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is upright;  <paragraph-break/>And all His work is done in faithfulness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>He loveth righteousness and justice;  <paragraph-break/>The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>By the word of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> were the heavens made;  <paragraph-break/>And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap;  <paragraph-break/>He layeth up the deeps in storehouses. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Let all the earth fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For He spoke, and it was;  <paragraph-break/>He commanded, and it stood. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The counsel of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> standeth for ever,  <paragraph-break/>The thoughts of His heart to all generations. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Happy is the nation whose God is the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>The people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> looketh from heaven;  <paragraph-break/>He beholdeth all the sons of men; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>From the place of His habitation He looketh intently  <paragraph-break/>Upon all the inhabitants of the earth; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>He that fashioneth the hearts of them all,  <paragraph-break/>That considereth all their doings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>A king is not saved by the multitude of a host;  <paragraph-break/>A mighty man is not delivered by great strength. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>9</verse-number>I am benumbed and sore crushed;  <paragraph-break/>I groan by reason of the moaning of my heart. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Lord, all my desire is before Thee;  <paragraph-break/>And my sighing is not hid from Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>My heart fluttereth, my strength faileth me;  <paragraph-break/>As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague;  <paragraph-break/>And my kinsmen stand afar off. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>They also that seek after my life lay snares for me;  <paragraph-break/>And they that seek my hurt speak crafty devices,  <paragraph-break/>And utter deceits all the day. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>But I am as a deaf man, I hear not;  <paragraph-break/>And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Yea, I am become as a man that heareth not,  <paragraph-break/>And in whose mouth are no arguments. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>For in Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, do I hope;  <paragraph-break/>Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over me;  <paragraph-break/>When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>For I am ready to halt,  <paragraph-break/>And my pain is continually before me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>For I do declare mine iniquity;  <paragraph-break/>I am full of care because of my sin. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>But mine enemies are strong in health;  <paragraph-break/>And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>They also that repay evil for good  <paragraph-break/>Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Forsake me not, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>O my God, be not far from me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Make haste to help me,  <paragraph-break/>O Lord, my salvation. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>39</chapter-number>For the Leader, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I said: 'I will take heed to my ways,  <paragraph-break/>That I sin not with my tongue;  <paragraph-break/>I will keep a curb upon my mouth,  <paragraph-break/>While the wicked is before me.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort;  <paragraph-break/>And my pain was held in check. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>My heart waxed hot within me;  <paragraph-break/>While I was musing, the fire kindled;  <paragraph-break/>Then spoke I with my tongue: <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>'<small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, make me to know mine end,  <paragraph-break/>And the measure of my days, what it is;  <paragraph-break/>Let me know how short-lived I am. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths;  <paragraph-break/>And mine age is as nothing before Thee;  <paragraph-break/>Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity.    Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Surely man walketh as a mere semblance;  <paragraph-break/>Surely for vanity they are in turmoil;  <paragraph-break/>He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And now, Lord, what wait I for?  <paragraph-break/>My hope, it is in Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Deliver me from all my transgressions;  <paragraph-break/>Make me not the reproach of the base. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>I am dumb, I open not my mouth;  <paragraph-break/>Because Thou hast done it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Remove Thy stroke from off me;  <paragraph-break/>I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity,  <paragraph-break/>And like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away;  <paragraph-break/>Surely every man is vanity.      Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Hear my prayer, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and give ear unto my cry;  <paragraph-break/>Keep not silence at my tears;  <paragraph-break/>For I am a stranger with Thee,  <paragraph-break/>A sojourner, as all my fathers were. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Look away from me, that I may take comfort,  <paragraph-break/>Before I go hence, and be no more.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>40</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I waited patiently for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>And He inclined unto me, and heard my cry. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>He brought me up also out of the tumultuous pit, out of the miry clay;  <paragraph-break/>And He set my feet upon a rock, He established my goings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Many shall see, and fear,  <paragraph-break/>And shall trust in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Happy is the man that hath made the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> his trust,  <paragraph-break/>And hath not turned unto the arrogant, nor unto such as fall away treacherously. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Many things hast Thou done, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God,  <paragraph-break/>Even Thy wonderful works, and Thy thoughts toward us;  <paragraph-break/>There is none to be compared unto Thee!  <paragraph-break/>If I would declare and speak of them,  <paragraph-break/>They are more than can be told. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou hast no delight in;  <paragraph-break/>Mine ears hast Thou opened;  <paragraph-break/>Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Then said I: 'Lo, I am come  <paragraph-break/>With the roll of a book which is prescribed for me; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>I delight to do Thy will, O my God;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation,  <paragraph-break/>Lo, I did not refrain my lips;  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou knowest. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart;  <paragraph-break/>I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation;  <paragraph-break/>I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, wilt not withhold Thy compassions from me;  <paragraph-break/>Let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually preserve me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For innumerable evils have compassed me about,  <paragraph-break/>Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;  <paragraph-break/>They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Be pleased, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, to deliver me;  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, make haste to help me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Let them be ashamed and abashed together  <paragraph-break/>That seek after my soul to sweep it away;  <paragraph-break/>Let them be turned backward and brought to confusion  <paragraph-break/>That delight in my hurt. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Let them be appalled by reason of their shame  <paragraph-break/>That say unto me: 'Aha, aha.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee;  <paragraph-break/>Let such as love Thy salvation say continually:  <paragraph-break/>'The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> be magnified.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>But, as for me, that am poor and needy,  <paragraph-break/>The Lord will account it unto me;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art my help and my deliverer;  <paragraph-break/>O my God, tarry not. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>41</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Happy is he that considereth the poor;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will deliver him in the day of evil. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land;  <paragraph-break/>And deliver not Thou him unto the greed of his enemies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> support him upon the bed of illness;  <paragraph-break/>Mayest Thou turn all his lying down in his sickness. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>As for me, I said: 'O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, be gracious unto me;  <paragraph-break/>Heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Mine enemies speak evil of me:  <paragraph-break/>'When shall he die, and his name perish?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And if one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood;  <paragraph-break/>His heart gathereth iniquity to itself;  <paragraph-break/>When he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>All that hate me whisper together against me,  <paragraph-break/>Against me do they devise my hurt: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto him;  <paragraph-break/>And now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread,  <paragraph-break/>Hath lifted up his heel against me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>But Thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, be gracious unto me, and raise me up,  <paragraph-break/>That I may requite them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>By this I know that Thou delightest in me,  <paragraph-break/>That mine enemy doth not triumph over me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>And as for me, Thou upholdest me because of mine integrity,  <paragraph-break/>And settest me before Thy face for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Blessed be the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the God of Israel,  <paragraph-break/>From everlasting and to everlasting.  <paragraph-break/>Amen, and Amen.  <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>2</verse-number>As the hart panteth after the water brooks,  <paragraph-break/>So panteth my soul after Thee, O God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:  <paragraph-break/>'When shall I come and appear before God?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>My tears have been my food day and night,  <paragraph-break/>While they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy God?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>How I passed on with the throng, and led them to the house of God,  <paragraph-break/>With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Why art thou cast down, O my soul?  <paragraph-break/>And why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him  <paragraph-break/>For the salvation of His countenance. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>O my God, my soul is cast down within me;  <paragraph-break/>Therefore do I remember Thee from the land of Jordan,  <paragraph-break/>And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts;  <paragraph-break/>All Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>By day the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will command His lovingkindness,  <paragraph-break/>And in the night His song shall be with me,  <paragraph-break/>Even a prayer unto the God of my life. <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>44</chapter-number>For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>A work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession,  <paragraph-break/>Neither did their own arm save them;  <paragraph-break/>But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance,  <paragraph-break/>Because Thou wast favourable unto them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou art my King, O God;  <paragraph-break/>Command the salvation of Jacob. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Through Thee do we push down our adversaries;  <paragraph-break/>Through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For I trust not in my bow,  <paragraph-break/>Neither can my sword save me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries,  <paragraph-break/>And hast put them to shame that hate us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>In God have we gloried all the day,  <paragraph-break/>And we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever.                      Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion;  <paragraph-break/>And goest not forth with our hosts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary;  <paragraph-break/>And they that hate us spoil at their will. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten;  <paragraph-break/>And hast scattered us among the nations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Thou sellest Thy people for small gain,  <paragraph-break/>And hast not set their prices high. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours,  <paragraph-break/>A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Thou makest us a byword among the nations,  <paragraph-break/>A shaking of the head among the peoples. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>All the day is my confusion before me,  <paragraph-break/>And the shame of my face hath covered me, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth;  <paragraph-break/>By reason of the enemy and the revengeful. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee,  <paragraph-break/>Neither have we been false to Thy covenant. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Our heart is not turned back,  <paragraph-break/>Neither have our steps declined from Thy path; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals,  <paragraph-break/>And covered us with the shadow of death. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>If we had forgotten the name of our God,  <paragraph-break/>Or spread forth our hands to a strange god; 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Would not God search this out?  <paragraph-break/>For He knoweth the secrets of the heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day;  <paragraph-break/>We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord?  <paragraph-break/>Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face,  <paragraph-break/>And forgettest our affliction and our oppression? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>For our soul is bowed down to the dust;  <paragraph-break/>Our belly cleaveth unto the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>Arise for our help,  <paragraph-break/>And redeem us for Thy mercy's sake. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou art fairer than the children of men;  <paragraph-break/>Grace is poured upon thy lips;  <paragraph-break/>Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one,  <paragraph-break/>Thy glory and thy majesty. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>And in thy majesty prosper, ride on,  <paragraph-break/>In behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>And let thy right hand teach thee tremendous things. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thine arrows are sharp—  <paragraph-break/>The peoples fall under thee—  <paragraph-break/>[They sink] into the heart of the king's enemies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Thy throne given of God is for ever and ever;  <paragraph-break/>A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness;  <paragraph-break/>Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee  <paragraph-break/>With the oil of gladness above thy fellows. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are all thy garments;  <paragraph-break/>Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Kings' daughters are among thy favourites;  <paragraph-break/>At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>'Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;  <paragraph-break/>Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>So shall the king desire thy beauty;  <paragraph-break/>For he is thy lord; and do homage unto him. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people  <paragraph-break/>Shall entreat thy favour with a gift.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace;  <paragraph-break/>Her raiment is of chequer work inwrought with gold. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>She shall be led unto the king on richly woven stuff;  <paragraph-break/>The virgins her companions in her train being brought unto thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing;  <paragraph-break/>They shall enter into the king's palace. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons,  <paragraph-break/>Whom thou shalt make princes in all the land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations;  <paragraph-break/>Therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>46</chapter-number>For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah; upon Alamoth. A Song.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>God is our refuge and strength,  <paragraph-break/>A  very present help in trouble. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change,  <paragraph-break/>And though the mountains be moved into the heart of the seas; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Though the waters thereof roar and foam,  <paragraph-break/>Though the mountains shake at the swelling thereof.                   Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God,  <paragraph-break/>The holiest dwelling-place of the Most High. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved;  <paragraph-break/>God shall help her, at the approach of morning. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Nations were in tumult, kingdoms were moved;  <paragraph-break/>He uttered His voice, the earth melted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of hosts is with us;  The God of Jacob is our high tower.                           Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Come, behold the works of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Who hath made desolations in the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder;  <paragraph-break/>He burneth the chariots in the fire. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>'Let be, and know that I am God;  <paragraph-break/>I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of hosts is with us;  <paragraph-break/>The God of Jacob is our high tower.                Selah <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>47</chapter-number>For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O clap your hands, all ye peoples;  <paragraph-break/>Shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is most high, awful;  <paragraph-break/>A great King over all the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>He subdueth peoples under us,  <paragraph-break/>And nations under our feet. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>He chooseth our inheritance for us,  The pride of Jacob whom He loveth. Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>God is gone up amidst shouting,  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> amidst the sound of the horn. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Sing praises to God, sing praises;  <paragraph-break/>Sing praises unto our King, sing praises. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>For God is the King of all the earth;  <paragraph-break/>Sing ye praises in a skilful song. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>God reigneth over the nations;  <paragraph-break/>God sitteth upon His holy throne. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The princes of the peoples are gathered together,  <paragraph-break/>The people of the God of Abraham;  <paragraph-break/>For unto God belong the shields of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>He is greatly exalted. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>48</chapter-number>A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Great is the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and highly to be praised,  <paragraph-break/>In the city of our God, His holy mountain, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth;  <paragraph-break/>Even mount Zion, the uttermost parts of the north,  <paragraph-break/>The city of the great King. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>God in her palaces  <paragraph-break/>Hath made Himself known for a stronghold. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,  <paragraph-break/>They came onward together. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>They saw, straightway they were amazed;  <paragraph-break/>They were affrighted, they hasted away. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Trembling took hold of them there,  <paragraph-break/>Pangs, as of a woman in travail. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>With the east wind  <paragraph-break/>Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>As we have heard, so have we seen  <paragraph-break/>In the city of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of hosts, in the city of our God— <paragraph-break/>God establish it for ever.          Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O God,  <paragraph-break/>In the midst of Thy temple. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>As is Thy name, O God,  <paragraph-break/>So is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>Thy right hand is full of righteousness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Let mount Zion be glad,  <paragraph-break/>Let the daughters of Judah rejoice,  <paragraph-break/>Because of Thy judgments. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Walk about Zion, and go round about her;  <paragraph-break/>Count the towers thereof. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Mark ye well her ramparts,  <paragraph-break/>Traverse her palaces;  <paragraph-break/>That ye may tell it to the generation following. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>For such is God, our God, for ever and ever;  <paragraph-break/>He will guide us eternally. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>49</chapter-number>For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Hear this, all ye peoples;  <paragraph-break/>Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Both low and high,  <paragraph-break/>Rich and poor together. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>My mouth shall speak wisdom,  <paragraph-break/>And the meditation of my heart shall be understanding. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I will incline mine ear to a parable;  <paragraph-break/>I will open my dark saying upon the harp. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,  <paragraph-break/>When the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Of them that trust in their wealth,  <paragraph-break/>And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>No man can by any means redeem his brother,  <paragraph-break/>Nor give to God a ransom for him—  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For too costly is the redemption of their soul,  <paragraph-break/>And must be let alone for ever—  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>That he should still live alway,  <paragraph-break/>That he should not see the pit. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>For he seeth that wise men die,  <paragraph-break/>The fool and the brutish together perish,  <paragraph-break/>And leave their wealth to others. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,  <paragraph-break/>And their dwelling-places to all generations;  <paragraph-break/>They call their lands after their own names. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>But man abideth not in honour;  <paragraph-break/>He is like the beasts that perish. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>This is the way of them that are foolish,  <paragraph-break/>And of those who after them approve their sayings.          Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world;  <paragraph-break/>Death shall be their shepherd;  <paragraph-break/>And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;  <paragraph-break/>And their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away,  <paragraph-break/>That there be no habitation for it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world;  <paragraph-break/>For He shall receive me.          Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich,  <paragraph-break/>When the wealth of his house is increased; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away;  <paragraph-break/>His wealth shall not descend after him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Though while he lived he blessed his soul:  <paragraph-break/>'Men will praise thee, when thou shalt do well to thyself'; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>It shall go to the generation of his fathers;  <paragraph-break/>They shall never see the light. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Man that is in honour understandeth not;  <paragraph-break/>He is like the beasts that perish. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>50</chapter-number>A Psalm of Asaph.   <paragraph-break/>God, God, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hath spoken, and called the earth  <paragraph-break/>From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,  <paragraph-break/>God hath shined forth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence;  <paragraph-break/>A fire devoureth before Him,  <paragraph-break/>And round about Him it stormeth mightily. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>He calleth to the heavens above,  <paragraph-break/>And to the earth, that He may judge His people: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>'Gather My saints together unto Me;  <paragraph-break/>Those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>And the heavens declare His righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>For God, He is judge.               Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>'Hear, O My people, and I will speak;  <paragraph-break/>O Israel, and I will testify against thee:  <paragraph-break/>God, thy God, am I. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices;  <paragraph-break/>And thy burnt-offerings are continually before Me. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>I will take no bullock out of thy house,  <paragraph-break/>Nor he-goats out of thy folds. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For every beast of the forest is Mine,  <paragraph-break/>And the cattle upon a thousand hills. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>I know all the fowls of the mountains;  <paragraph-break/>And the wild beasts of the field are Mine. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee;  <paragraph-break/>For the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Do I eat the flesh of bulls,  <paragraph-break/>Or drink the blood of goats? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving;  <paragraph-break/>And pay thy vows unto the Most High; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>And call upon Me in the day of trouble;  <paragraph-break/>I will deliver thee, and thou shalt honour Me.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>But unto the wicked God saith:  <paragraph-break/>'What hast thou to do to declare My statutes,  <paragraph-break/>And that thou hast taken My covenant in thy mouth? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Seeing thou hatest instruction,  <paragraph-break/>And castest My words behind thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>When thou sawest a thief, thou hadst company with him,  <paragraph-break/>And with adulterers was thy portion. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Thou hast let loose thy mouth for evil,  <paragraph-break/>And thy tongue frameth deceit. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother;  <paragraph-break/>Thou slanderest thine own mother's son. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>These things hast thou done, and should I have kept silence?  <paragraph-break/>Thou hadst thought that I was altogether such a one as thyself;  <paragraph-break/>But I will reprove thee, and set the cause before thine eyes. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Now consider this, ye that forget God,  <paragraph-break/>Lest I tear in pieces, and there be none to deliver. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving honoureth Me;  <paragraph-break/>And to him that ordereth his way aright  <paragraph-break/>Will I show the salvation of God.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>51</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David; <verse-number>2</verse-number>when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Be gracious unto me, O God, according to Thy mercy;  <paragraph-break/>According to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,  <paragraph-break/>And cleanse me from my sin. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For I know my transgressions;  <paragraph-break/>And my sin is ever before me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned,  
         <paragraph-break/>And done that which is evil in Thy sight;  <paragraph-break/>That Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest,  <paragraph-break/>And be in the right when Thou judgest. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,  <paragraph-break/>And in sin did my mother conceive me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts;  <paragraph-break/>Make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;  <paragraph-break/>Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Make me to hear joy and gladness;  <paragraph-break/>That the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Hide Thy face from my sins,  <paragraph-break/>Aand blot out all mine iniquities. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Create me a clean heart, O God;  <paragraph-break/>And renew a stedfast spirit within me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Cast me not away from Thy presence;  <paragraph-break/>And take not Thy holy spirit from me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation;  <paragraph-break/>And let a willing spirit uphold me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways;  <paragraph-break/>And sinners shall return unto Thee. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation;  <paragraph-break/>So shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>O Lord, open Thou my lips;  <paragraph-break/>And my mouth shall declare Thy praise. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;  <paragraph-break/>A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Do good in Thy favour unto Zion;  <paragraph-break/>Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Then wilt Thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering;  <paragraph-break/>Then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>52</chapter-number>For the Leader. Maschil of David; <verse-number>2</verse-number>when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him: 'David is come to the house of Ahimelech.'  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Why boastest thou thyself of evil, O mighty man?  <paragraph-break/>The mercy of God endureth continually. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Thy tongue deviseth destruction;  <paragraph-break/>Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou lovest evil more than good;  <paragraph-break/>Falsehood rather than speaking righteousness.                       Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thou lovest all devouring words,  <paragraph-break/>The deceitful tongue. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>God will likewise break thee for ever,  <paragraph-break/>He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent,  <paragraph-break/>And root thee out of the land of the living.                                   Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The righteous also shall see, and fear,  <paragraph-break/>And shall laugh at him: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>'Lo, this is the man that made not God his stronghold;  <paragraph-break/>But trusted in the abundance of his riches,  <paragraph-break/>And strengthened himself in his wickedness.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>But as for me, I am like a leafy olive-tree in the house of God;  <paragraph-break/>I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>I will give Thee thanks for ever, because Thou hast done it;  <paragraph-break/>And I will wait for Thy name, for it is good, in the presence of Thy saints. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>53</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon Mahalath. Maschil of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God';  <paragraph-break/>They have dealt corruptly, and have done abominable iniquity;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>There is none that doeth good. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>God looked forth from heaven upon the children of men,  <paragraph-break/>To see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Every one of them is unclean, they are together become impure;  <paragraph-break/>There is none that doeth good, no, not one. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>‘Shall not the workers of iniquity know it,  <paragraph-break/>Who eat up My people as they eat bread,  <paragraph-break/>And call not upon God?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>There are they in great fear, where no fear was;  <paragraph-break/>For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!  <paragraph-break/>When God turneth the captivity of His people,  <paragraph-break/>Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>54</chapter-number>For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David: <verse-number>2</verse-number>when the Ziphites came and said to Saul: 'Doth not David hide himself with us?'  <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>O God, save me by Thy name,  <paragraph-break/>And right me by Thy might. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For strangers are risen up against me,  <paragraph-break/>And violent men have sought after my soul;  <paragraph-break/>They have not set God before them.                                                       Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Behold, God is my helper;  <paragraph-break/>The Lord is for me as the upholder of my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He will requite the evil unto them that lie in wait for me;  <paragraph-break/>Destroy Thou them in Thy truth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto Thee;  <paragraph-break/>I will give thanks unto Thy name, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for it is good. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For He hath delivered me out of all trouble;  <paragraph-break/>And mine eye hath gazed upon mine enemies. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>55</chapter-number>For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Give ear, O God, to my prayer;  <paragraph-break/>And hide not Thyself from my supplication. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Attend unto me, and answer me;  <paragraph-break/>I am distraught in my complaint, and will moan; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Because of the voice of the enemy,  <paragraph-break/>Because of the oppression of the wicked;  <paragraph-break/>For they cast mischief upon me,  <paragraph-break/>And in anger they persecute me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>My heart doth writhe within me;  <paragraph-break/>And the terrors of death are fallen upon me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Fear and trembling come upon me,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And horror hath overwhelmed me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And I said: 'Oh that I had wings like a dove!  <paragraph-break/>Then would I fly away, and be at rest. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Lo, then would I wander far off,  <paragraph-break/>I would lodge in the wilderness.  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>I would haste me to a shelter  <paragraph-break/>From the stormy wind and tempest.'  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue;  <paragraph-break/>For I have seen violence and strife in the city. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof;  <paragraph-break/>Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Wickedness is in the midst thereof;  <paragraph-break/>Oppression and guile depart not from her broad place. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For it was not an enemy that taunted me,  <paragraph-break/>Then I could have borne it;  <paragraph-break/>Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me,  <paragraph-break/>Then I would have hid myself from him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>But it was thou, a man mine equal,  <paragraph-break/>My companion, and my familiar friend; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>We took sweet counsel together,  <paragraph-break/>In the house of God we walked with the throng. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>May He incite death against them,  <paragraph-break/>Let them go down alive into the nether-world;  <paragraph-break/>For evil is in their dwelling, and within them. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>As for me, I will call upon God;  <paragraph-break/>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall save me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan;  <paragraph-break/>And He hath heard my voice. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me;  <paragraph-break/>For they were many that strove with me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>God shall hear, and humble them,  <paragraph-break/>Even He that is enthroned of old,  Selah <paragraph-break/>Such as have no changes,  <paragraph-break/>And fear not God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him;  <paragraph-break/>He hath profaned his covenant. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Smoother than cream were the speeches of his mouth,  <paragraph-break/>But his heart was war;  <paragraph-break/>His words were softer than oil,  <paragraph-break/>Yet were they keen-edged swords. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Cast thy burden upon the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and He will sustain thee;  <paragraph-break/>He will never suffer the righteous to be moved. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the nethermost pit;  <paragraph-break/>Men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days;  <paragraph-break/>But as for me, I will trust in Thee. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>56</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon Jonath-elem-rehokim. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam; when the Philistines took him in Gath.  <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Be gracious unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up;  <paragraph-break/>All the day he fighting oppresseth me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>They that lie in wait for me would swallow me up all the day;  <paragraph-break/>For they are many that fight against me, O Most High, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>In the day that I am afraid,  <paragraph-break/>I will put my trust in Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>In God—I will praise His word— <paragraph-break/>In God do I trust, I will not be afraid;  <paragraph-break/>What can flesh do unto me? <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>All the day they trouble mine affairs;  <paragraph-break/>All their thoughts are against me for evil. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,  <paragraph-break/>They mark my steps;  <paragraph-break/>According as they have waited for my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Because of iniquity cast them out;  <paragraph-break/>In anger bring down the peoples, O God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Thou has counted my wanderings;  <paragraph-break/>Put Thou my tears into Thy bottle;  <paragraph-break/>Are they not in Thy book? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call;  <paragraph-break/>This I know, that God is for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>In God—I will praise His word—  <paragraph-break/>In the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>—I will praise His word—  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>In God do I trust, I will not be afraid;  <paragraph-break/>What can man do unto me? 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Thy vows are upon me, O God;  <paragraph-break/>I will render thank-offerings unto Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>For thou hast delivered my soul from death;  <paragraph-break/>Hast Thou not delivered my feet from stumbling?  <paragraph-break/>That I may walk before God in the light of the living? <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>57</chapter-number>For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Be gracious unto me, O God, be gracious unto me,  <paragraph-break/>For in Thee hath my soul taken refuge;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I take refuge,  <paragraph-break/>Until calamities be overpast. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>I will cry unto God Most high;  <paragraph-break/>Unto God that accomplisheth it for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>He will send from heaven, and save me,  <paragraph-break/>When he that would swallow me up taunteth,                               Selah  <paragraph-break/>God shall send forth His mercy and His truth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>My soul is among lions, I do lie down among them that are aflame;  <paragraph-break/>Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,  <paragraph-break/>And their tongue a sharp sword. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Thy glory be above all the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>They have prepared a net for my steps,  <paragraph-break/>My soul is bowed down;  <paragraph-break/>They have digged a pit before me,  <paragraph-break/>They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves.              Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>My heart is stedfast, O God, my heart is stedfast;  <paragraph-break/>I will sing, yea, I will sing praises. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp;  <paragraph-break/>I will awake the dawn. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the peoples;  <paragraph-break/>I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>For Thy mercy is great unto the heavens,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy truth unto the skies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;  <paragraph-break/>Thy glory be above all the earth. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>58</chapter-number>For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company?  <paragraph-break/>Do ye judge with equity the sons of men? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Yea, in heart ye work wickedness;  <paragraph-break/>Ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The wicked are estranged from the womb;  <paragraph-break/>The speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Their venom is like the venom of a serpent;  <paragraph-break/>They are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers,  <paragraph-break/>Or of the most cunning binder of spells. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth;  <paragraph-break/>Break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Let them melt away as water that runneth apace;  <paragraph-break/>When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away;  <paragraph-break/>Like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Before your pots can feel the thorns,  <paragraph-break/>He will sweep it away with a whirlwind, the raw and the burning alike. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance;  <paragraph-break/>He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And men shall say: 'Verily there is a reward for the righteous;  <paragraph-break/>Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.' <paragraph-break/> For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam; 
         
         
            
         
         when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God;  <paragraph-break/>Set me on high from them that rise up against me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,  <paragraph-break/>And save me from the men of blood. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul;  <paragraph-break/>The impudent gather themselves together against me;  <paragraph-break/>Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Without my fault, they run and prepare themselves;  <paragraph-break/>Awake Thou to help me, and behold. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thou therefore, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> God of hosts, the God of Israel,  <paragraph-break/>Arouse Thyself to punish all the nations;  <paragraph-break/>Show no mercy to any iniquitous traitors.                                 Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>They return at evening, they howl like a dog,  <paragraph-break/>And go round about the city. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Behold, they belch out with their mouth;  <paragraph-break/>Swords are in their lips:  <paragraph-break/>'For who doth hear?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>But Thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, shalt laugh at them;  <paragraph-break/>Thou shalt have all the nations in derision. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Because of his strength, I will wait for Thee;  
         <paragraph-break/>For God is my high tower. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The God of my mercy will come to meet me;  <paragraph-break/>God will let me gaze upon mine adversaries. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Slay them not, lest my people forget,  <paragraph-break/>Make them wander to and fro by Thy power, and bring them down,  <paragraph-break/>O Lord our shield. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,  <paragraph-break/>Let them even be taken in their pride,  <paragraph-break/>And for cursing and lying which they speak. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more;  <paragraph-break/>And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob,  <paragraph-break/>Unto the ends of the earth.       Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>And they return at evening, they howl like a dog,  <paragraph-break/>And go round about the city; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>They wander up and down to devour,  <paragraph-break/>And tarry all night if they have not their fill. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>But as for me, I will sing of Thy strength;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy in the morning;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou hast been my high tower,  <paragraph-break/>And a refuge in the day of my distress. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>O my strength, unto Thee will I sing praises;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>60</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon Shushan Eduth; Michtam of David, to teach; <verse-number>2</verse-number>when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast broken us down;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast been angry; O restore us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it;  <paragraph-break/>Heal the breaches thereof; for it tottereth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou hast made Thy people to see hard things;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee,  <paragraph-break/>That it may be displayed because of the truth.                               Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>That Thy beloved may be delivered,  <paragraph-break/>Save with Thy right hand, and answer me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult;  <paragraph-break/>That I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;  <paragraph-break/>Ephraim also is the defence of my head;  <paragraph-break/>Judah is my sceptre. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Moab is my washpot;  <paragraph-break/>Upon Edom do I cast my shoe;  <paragraph-break/>Philistia, cry aloud because of me! <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Who will bring me into the fortified city?  <paragraph-break/>Who will lead me unto Edom? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off?  <paragraph-break/>And Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Give us help against the adversary;  <paragraph-break/>For vain is the help of man. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Through God we shall do valiantly;  <paragraph-break/>For He it is that will tread down our adversaries. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>61</chapter-number>For the Leader; with string-music. [A Psalm] of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Hear my cry, O God;  <paragraph-break/>Attend unto my prayer. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>From the end of the earth will I call unto Thee, when my heart fainteth;  <paragraph-break/>Lead me to a rock that is too high for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For Thou hast been a refuge for me,  <paragraph-break/>A tower of strength in the face of the enemy. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever;  <paragraph-break/>I will take refuge in the covert of Thy wings.                            Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>For Thou, O God, hast heard my vows;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast granted the heritage of those that fear Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Mayest Thou add days unto the king's days!  <paragraph-break/>May his years be as many generations! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>May he be enthroned before God for ever!  <paragraph-break/>Appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever,  <paragraph-break/>That I may daily perform my vows. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>62</chapter-number>For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Only for God doth my soul wait in stillness;  <paragraph-break/>From Him cometh my salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>He only is my rock and my salvation,  <paragraph-break/>My high tower, I shall not be greatly moved. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>How long will ye set upon a man,  <paragraph-break/>That ye may slay him, all of you,  <paragraph-break/>As a leaning wall, a tottering fence? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>They only devise to thrust him down from his height, delighting in lies;  <paragraph-break/>They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.      Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Only for God wait thou in stillness, my soul;  <paragraph-break/>For from Him cometh my hope. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He only is my rock and my salvation,  <paragraph-break/>My high tower, I shall not be moved. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Upon God resteth my salvation and my glory;  <paragraph-break/>The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Trust in Him at all times, ye people;  <paragraph-break/>Pour out your heart before Him;  <paragraph-break/>God is a refuge for us.              Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie;  <paragraph-break/>If they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Trust not in oppression,  <paragraph-break/>And put not vain hope in robbery;  <paragraph-break/>If riches increase, set not your heart thereon. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>God hath spoken once,  <paragraph-break/>Twice have I heard this:  <paragraph-break/>That strength belongeth unto God; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou renderest to every man according to his work. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>63</chapter-number>A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O God, Thou art my God, earnestly will I seek Thee;  <paragraph-break/>My soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee,  <paragraph-break/>In a dry and weary land, where no water is. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>So have I looked for Thee in the sanctuary,  <paragraph-break/>To see Thy power and Thy glory. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For Thy lovingkindness is better than life;  <paragraph-break/>My lips shall praise Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>So will I bless Thee as long as I live;  <paragraph-break/>In Thy name will I lift up my hands. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness;  <paragraph-break/>And my mouth doth praise Thee with joyful lips; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>When I remember Thee upon my couch,  <paragraph-break/>And meditate on Thee in the night-watches. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>For Thou hast been my help,  <paragraph-break/>And in the shadow of Thy wings do I rejoice. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>My soul cleaveth unto Thee;  <paragraph-break/>Thy right hand holdeth me fast. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>But those that seek my soul, to destroy it,  <paragraph-break/>Shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>They shall be hurled to the power of the sword;  <paragraph-break/>They shall be a portion for foxes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>But the king shall rejoice in God;  <paragraph-break/>Every one that sweareth by Him shall glory;  <paragraph-break/>For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>64</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint;  <paragraph-break/>Preserve my life from the terror of the enemy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Hide me from the council of evil-doers;  <paragraph-break/>From the tumult of the workers of iniquity; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Who have whet their tongue like a sword,  <paragraph-break/>And have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless;  <paragraph-break/>Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>They encourage one another in an evil matter;  <paragraph-break/>They converse of laying snares secretly;  <paragraph-break/>They ask, who would see them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search;  <paragraph-break/>Even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>But God doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly;  <paragraph-break/>Thence are their wounds. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves;  <paragraph-break/>All that see them shake the head. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>And all men fear;  <paragraph-break/>And they declare the work of God,  <paragraph-break/>And understand His doing. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The righteous shall be glad in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and shall take refuge in Him;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And all the upright in heart shall glory. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>65</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm.  A Song of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in Zion;  <paragraph-break/>And unto Thee the vow is performed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>O Thou that hearest prayer,  <paragraph-break/>Unto Thee doth all flesh come. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me;  <paragraph-break/>As for our transgressions, Thou wilt pardon them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Happy is the man whom Thou choosest, and bringest near,  <paragraph-break/>That he may dwell in Thy courts;  <paragraph-break/>May we be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house,  <paragraph-break/>The holy place of Thy temple! <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>With wondrous works dost Thou answer us in righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>O God of our salvation;  <paragraph-break/>Thou the confidence of all the ends of the earth,  <paragraph-break/>And of the far distant seas; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Who by Thy strength settest fast the mountains,  <paragraph-break/>Who art girded about with might; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Who stillest the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves,  <paragraph-break/>And the tumult of the peoples; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of Thy signs;  
         <paragraph-break/>Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Thou hast remembered the earth, and watered her, greatly enriching her,  <paragraph-break/>With the river of God that is full of water;  <paragraph-break/>Thou preparest them corn, for so preparest Thou her. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Watering her ridges abundantly,  <paragraph-break/>Settling down the furrows thereof,  <paragraph-break/>Thou makest her soft with showers;  <paragraph-break/>Thou blessest the growth thereof. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness;  <paragraph-break/>And Thy paths drop fatness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>The pastures of the wilderness do drop;  <paragraph-break/>And the hills are girded with joy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>The meadows are clothed with flocks;  <paragraph-break/>The valleys also are covered over with corn;  <paragraph-break/>They shout for joy, yea, they sing. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>66</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Song, a Psalm.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>Shout unto God, all the earth; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Sing praises unto the glory of His name;  <paragraph-break/>Make His praise glorious. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Say unto God: 'How tremendous is Thy work!  <paragraph-break/>Through the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies dwindle away before Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>All the earth shall worship Thee,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And shall sing praises unto Thee;  <paragraph-break/>They shall sing praises to Thy name.'                                   Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Come, and see the works of God;  <paragraph-break/>He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>He turned the sea into dry land;  <paragraph-break/>They went through the river on foot;  <paragraph-break/>There let us rejoice in Him! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Who ruleth by His might for ever;  <paragraph-break/>His eyes keep watch upon the nations;  <paragraph-break/>Let not the rebellious exalt themselves.                           Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Bless our God, ye peoples,  <paragraph-break/>And make the voice of His praise to be heard; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Who hath set our soul in life,  <paragraph-break/>And suffered not our foot to be moved, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For Thou, O God, hast tried us;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast refined us, as silver is refined. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Thou didst bring us into the hold;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst lay constraint upon our loins. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads;  <paragraph-break/>We went through fire and through water;  <paragraph-break/>But Thou didst bring us out unto abundance. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>I will come into Thy house with burnt-offerings,  <paragraph-break/>I will perform unto Thee my vows, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Which my lips have uttered,  
         <paragraph-break/>And my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings,  <paragraph-break/>With the sweet smoke of rams;  <paragraph-break/>I will offer bullocks with goats.  Selah<paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Come, and hearken, all ye that fear God,  <paragraph-break/>And I will declare what He hath done for my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>I cried unto Him with my mouth,  <paragraph-break/>And He was extolled with my tongue. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>If I had regarded iniquity in my heart,  <paragraph-break/>The Lord would not hear; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>But verily God hath heard;  <paragraph-break/>He hath attended to the voice of my prayer. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Blessed be God,  <paragraph-break/>Who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>67</chapter-number>For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm, a Song.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>God be gracious unto us, and bless us;  <paragraph-break/>May He cause His face to shine toward us;                             Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>That Thy way may be known upon earth,  <paragraph-break/>Thy salvation among all nations. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O God;  <paragraph-break/>Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>O let the nations be glad and sing for joy;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou wilt judge the peoples with equity,  <paragraph-break/>And lead the nations upon earth.  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O God;  <paragraph-break/>Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>The earth hath yielded her increase;  <paragraph-break/>May God, our own God, bless us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>May God bless us;  <paragraph-break/>And let all the ends of the earth fear Him. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>68</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David, a Song.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered;  <paragraph-break/>And let them that hate Him flee before Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>As smoke is driven away, so drive them away;  <paragraph-break/>As wax melteth before the fire,  <paragraph-break/>So let the wicked perish at the presence of God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>But let the righteous be glad, let them exult before God;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, let them rejoice with gladness. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Sing unto God, sing praises to His name;  <paragraph-break/>Extol Him that rideth upon the skies, whose name is the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>And exult ye before Him. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows,  <paragraph-break/>Is God in His holy habitation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>God maketh the solitary to dwell in a house;  <paragraph-break/>He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity;  <paragraph-break/>The rebellious dwell but in a parched land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>O God, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people,  <paragraph-break/>When Thou didst march through the wilderness;                           Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God;  <paragraph-break/>Even yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>A bounteous rain didst Thou pour down, O God;  <paragraph-break/>When Thine inheritance was weary, Thou didst confirm it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Thy flock settled therein;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst prepare in Thy goodness for the poor, O God. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>The Lord giveth the word;  <paragraph-break/>The women that proclaim the tidings are a great host. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Kings of armies flee, they flee;  <paragraph-break/>And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>When ye lie among the sheepfolds,  <paragraph-break/>The wings of the dove are covered with silver,  <paragraph-break/>And her pinions with the shimmer of gold. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>When the Almighty scattereth kings therein,  <paragraph-break/>It snoweth in Zalmon. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;  <paragraph-break/>A mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Why look ye askance, ye mountains of peaks,  <paragraph-break/>At the mountain which God hath desired for His abode?  <paragraph-break/>Yea, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will dwell therein for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>The chariots of God are myriads, even thousands upon thousands;  <paragraph-break/>The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in holiness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast received gifts among men,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, among the rebellious also, that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> God might dwell there. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Blessed be the Lord, day by day He beareth our burden,  <paragraph-break/>Even the God who is our salvation.  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>God is unto us a God of deliverances;  <paragraph-break/>And unto <small-caps>God</small-caps> the Lord belong the issues of death. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Surely God will smite through the head of His enemies,  <paragraph-break/>The hairy scalp of him that goeth about in his guiltiness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>The Lord said: 'I will bring back from Bashan,  
         <paragraph-break/>I will bring them back from the depths of the sea; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>That thy foot may wade through blood,  <paragraph-break/>That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>They see Thy goings, O God,  <paragraph-break/>Even the goings of my God, my King, in holiness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>The singers go before, the minstrels follow after,  <paragraph-break/>In the midst of damsels playing upon timbrels. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>'Bless ye God in full assemblies,  <paragraph-break/>Even the Lord, ye that are from the fountain of Israel.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them,  <paragraph-break/>The princes of Judah their council,  <paragraph-break/>The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>Thy God hath commanded thy strength;  <paragraph-break/>Be strong, O God, Thou that hast wrought for us <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>Out of Thy temple at Jerusalem,  <paragraph-break/>Whither kings shall bring presents unto Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds,  <paragraph-break/>The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples,  <paragraph-break/>Every one submitting himself with pieces of silver;  <paragraph-break/>He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>Nobles shall come out of Egypt;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hands unto God. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>O sing praises unto the Lord;  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>To Him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old;  <paragraph-break/>Lo, He uttereth His voice, a mighty voice. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>Ascribe ye strength unto God;  <paragraph-break/>His majesty is over Israel,  <paragraph-break/>And His strength is in the skies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>Awful is God out of thy holy places;  <paragraph-break/>The God of Israel, He giveth strength and power unto the people;  <paragraph-break/>Blessed be God. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>69</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Save me, O God;  <paragraph-break/>For the waters are come in even unto the soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing;  <paragraph-break/>I am come into deep waters, and the flood overwhelmeth me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried;  <paragraph-break/>Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;  <paragraph-break/>They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many;  <paragraph-break/>Should I restore that which I took not away? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>O God, Thou knowest my folly;  <paragraph-break/>And my trespasses are not hid from Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord <small-caps>God</small-caps> of hosts;  <paragraph-break/>Let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach;  <paragraph-break/>Confusion hath covered my face. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>I am become a stranger unto my brethren,  <paragraph-break/>And an alien unto my mother's children. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Because zeal for Thy house hath eaten me up,  <paragraph-break/>And the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And I wept with my soul with fasting,  <paragraph-break/>And that became unto me a reproach. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>I made sackcloth also my garment,  <paragraph-break/>And I became a byword unto them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>They that sit in the gate talk of me;  <paragraph-break/>And I am the song of the drunkards. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>But as for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in an acceptable time;  <paragraph-break/>O God, in the abundance of Thy mercy,  <paragraph-break/>Answer me with the truth of Thy salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink;  <paragraph-break/>Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,  <paragraph-break/>Neither let the deep swallow me up;  <paragraph-break/>And let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Answer me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for Thy mercy is good;  <paragraph-break/>According to the multitude of Thy compassions turn Thou unto me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>And hide not Thy face from Thy servant;  <paragraph-break/>For I am in distress; answer me speedily. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it;  <paragraph-break/>Ransom me because of mine enemies. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion;  <paragraph-break/>Mine adversaries are all before Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick;  <paragraph-break/>And I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none;  
         <paragraph-break/>And for comforters, but I found none. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Yea, they put poison into my food;  <paragraph-break/>And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Let their table before them become a snare;  <paragraph-break/>And when they are in peace, let it become a trap. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not;  <paragraph-break/>And make their loins continually to totter. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Pour out Thine indignation upon them,  <paragraph-break/>And let the fierceness of Thine anger overtake them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>Let their encampment be desolate;  <paragraph-break/>Let none dwell in their tents. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>For they persecute him whom Thou hast smitten;  <paragraph-break/>And they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>Add iniquity unto their iniquity;  <paragraph-break/>And let them not come into Thy righteousness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,  <paragraph-break/>And not be written with the righteous. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>But I am afflicted and in pain;  <paragraph-break/>Let Thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>I will praise the name of God with a song,  <paragraph-break/>And will magnify Him with thanksgiving. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>And it shall please the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> better than a bullock  <paragraph-break/>That hath horns and hoofs. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>The humble shall see it, and be glad;  <paragraph-break/>Ye that seek after God, let your heart revive. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hearkeneth unto the needy,  <paragraph-break/>And despiseth not His prisoners. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>Let heaven and earth praise Him,  <paragraph-break/>The seas, and every thing that moveth therein. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah;  <paragraph-break/>And they shall abide there, and have it in possession. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>The seed also of His servants shall inherit it;  <paragraph-break/>And they that love His name shall dwell therein. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>70</chapter-number>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David; to make memorial.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>O God, to deliver me,  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, to help me, make haste. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Let them be ashamed and abashed  <paragraph-break/>That seek after my soul;  <paragraph-break/>Let them be turned backward and brought to confusion  <paragraph-break/>That delight in my hurt. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Let them be turned back by reason of their shame  <paragraph-break/>That say: 'Aha, aha.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee;  <paragraph-break/>And let such as love Thy salvation say continually:  
         <paragraph-break/>'Let God be magnified.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>But I am poor and needy;  <paragraph-break/>O God, make haste unto me;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art my help and my deliverer;  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, tarry not. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>71</chapter-number>In Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, have I  taken  refuge;  <paragraph-break/>Let me never be ashamed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Deliver me in Thy righteousness, and rescue me;  <paragraph-break/>Incline Thine ear unto me, and save me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Be Thou to me a sheltering rock, whereunto I may continually resort,  <paragraph-break/>Which Thou hast appointed to save me;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou art my rock and my fortress. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>O my God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked,  <paragraph-break/>Out of the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For Thou art my hope;  <paragraph-break/>O Lord <small-caps>God</small-caps>, my trust from my youth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Upon Thee have I stayed myself from birth;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb;  <paragraph-break/>My praise is continually of Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>I am as a wonder unto many;  <paragraph-break/>But Thou art my strong refuge. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>My mouth shall be filled with Thy praise,  <paragraph-break/>And with Thy glory all the day. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Cast me not off in the time of old age;  <paragraph-break/>When my strength faileth, forsake me not. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For mine enemies speak concerning me,  <paragraph-break/>And they that watch for my soul take counsel together, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Saying: 'God hath forsaken him;  <paragraph-break/>Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>O God, be not far from me;  <paragraph-break/>O my God, make haste to help me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Let them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;  <paragraph-break/>Let them be covered with reproach and confusion that seek my hurt. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>But as for me, I will hope continually,  <paragraph-break/>And will praise Thee yet more and more. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>My mouth shall tell of Thy righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And of Thy salvation all the day;  <paragraph-break/>For I know not the numbers thereof. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>I will come with Thy mighty acts, O Lord <small-caps>God</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>I will make mention of Thy righteousness, even of Thine only. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth;  <paragraph-break/>And until now do I declare Thy wondrous works. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>And even unto old age and hoary hairs, O God, forsake me not;  
         <paragraph-break/>Until I have declared Thy strength unto the next generation,  <paragraph-break/>Thy might to every one that is to come. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Thy righteousness also, O God, which reacheth unto high heaven;  <paragraph-break/>Thou who hast done great things,  <paragraph-break/>O God, who is like unto Thee? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thou, who hast made me to see many and sore troubles,  <paragraph-break/>Wilt quicken me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Thou wilt increase my greatness,  <paragraph-break/>And turn and comfort me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>I also will give thanks unto Thee with the psaltery,  <paragraph-break/>Even unto Thy truth, O my God;  <paragraph-break/>I will sing praises unto Thee with the harp,  <paragraph-break/>O Thou Holy One of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto Thee;  <paragraph-break/>And my soul, which Thou hast redeemed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>My tongue also shall tell of Thy righteousness all the day;  <paragraph-break/>For they are ashamed, for they are abashed, that seek my hurt. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>72</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of Solomon.   <paragraph-break/>Give the king Thy judgments, O God,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy righteousness unto the king's son; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>That he may judge Thy people with righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy poor with justice. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Let the mountains bear peace to the people,  <paragraph-break/>And the hills, through righteousness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>May he judge the poor of the people,  <paragraph-break/>And save the children of the needy,  <paragraph-break/>And crush the oppressor. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth,  <paragraph-break/>And so long as the moon, throughout all generations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>May he come down like rain upon the mown grass,  <paragraph-break/>As showers that water the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>In his days let the righteous flourish,  <paragraph-break/>And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>May he have dominion also from sea to sea,  <paragraph-break/>And from the River unto the ends of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Let them that dwell in the wilderness bow before him;  <paragraph-break/>And his enemies lick the dust. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute;  <paragraph-break/>The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Yea, all kings shall prostrate themselves before him;  <paragraph-break/>All nations shall serve him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>For he will deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>He will have pity on the poor and needy,  
         <paragraph-break/>And the souls of the needy he will save. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence,  <paragraph-break/>And precious will their blood be in his sight. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>That they may live, and that he may give them of the gold of Sheba,  <paragraph-break/>That they may pray for him continually,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, bless him all the day. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>May he be as a rich cornfield in the land upon the top of the mountains;  <paragraph-break/>May his fruit rustle like Lebanon;  <paragraph-break/>And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>May his name endure for ever;  <paragraph-break/>May his name be continued as long as the sun;  <paragraph-break/>May men also bless themselves by him;  <paragraph-break/>May all nations call him happy. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>73</chapter-number>A Psalm of Asaph.   <paragraph-break/>Surely  God is good to Israel,  <paragraph-break/>Even to such as are pure in heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>But as for me, my feet were almost gone;  <paragraph-break/>My steps had well nigh slipped. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For I was envious at the arrogant,  <paragraph-break/>When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For there are no pangs at their death,  <paragraph-break/>And their body is sound. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>In the trouble of man they are not;  <paragraph-break/>Neither are they plagued like men. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck;  <paragraph-break/>Violence covereth them as a garment. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Their eyes stand forth from fatness;  <paragraph-break/>They are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression;  <paragraph-break/>They speak as if there were none on high. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>They have set their mouth against the heavens,  <paragraph-break/>And their tongue walketh through the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Therefore His people return hither;  <paragraph-break/>And waters of fullness are drained out by them. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And they say: 'How doth God know?  <paragraph-break/>And is there knowledge in the Most High?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Behold, such are the wicked;  <paragraph-break/>And they that are always at ease increase riches. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,  <paragraph-break/>And washed my hands in innocency; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>For all the day have I been plagued,  <paragraph-break/>And my chastisement came every morning. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>If I had said: 'I will speak thus',  <paragraph-break/>Behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And when I pondered how I might know this,  <paragraph-break/>It was wearisome in mine eyes; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Until I entered into the sanctuary of God,  <paragraph-break/>And considered their end. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>Surely Thou settest them in slippery places;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>How are they become a desolation in a moment!  <paragraph-break/>They are wholly consumed by terrors. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>As a dream when one awaketh,  <paragraph-break/>So, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>For my heart was in a ferment,  <paragraph-break/>And I was pricked in my reins. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>But I was brutish, and ignorant;  <paragraph-break/>I was as a beast before Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Nevertheless I am continually with Thee;  <paragraph-break/>Thou holdest my right hand. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel,  <paragraph-break/>And afterward receive me with glory. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Whom have I in heaven but Thee?  <paragraph-break/>And beside Thee I desire none upon earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>My flesh and my heart faileth;  <paragraph-break/>But God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish;  <paragraph-break/>Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>But as for me, the nearness of God is my good;  <paragraph-break/>I have made the Lord <small-caps>God</small-caps> my refuge,  <paragraph-break/>That I may tell of all Thy works. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>74</chapter-number>Maschil of Asaph.   <paragraph-break/>Why, O God, hast Thou cast us off for ever?  <paragraph-break/>Why doth Thine anger smoke against the flock of Thy pasture? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old,  <paragraph-break/>Which Thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of Thine inheritance;  <paragraph-break/>And mount Zion, wherein Thou hast dwelt. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Lift up Thy steps because of the perpetual ruins,  <paragraph-break/>Even all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy meeting-place;  <paragraph-break/>They have set up their own signs for signs. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>It seemed as when men wield upwards  <paragraph-break/>Axes in a thicket of trees. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>And now all the carved work thereof together  <paragraph-break/>They strike down with hatchet and hammers. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>They have set Thy sanctuary on fire;  <paragraph-break/>They have profaned the dwelling-place of Thy name even to the ground. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>They said in their heart: 'Let us make havoc of them altogether';  <paragraph-break/>They have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>We see not our signs;  <paragraph-break/>There is no more any prophet;  <paragraph-break/>Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach?  <paragraph-break/>Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy name for ever? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand?  <paragraph-break/>Draw it out of Thy bosom and consume them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Yet God is my King of old,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Working salvation in the midst of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Thou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan,  <paragraph-break/>Thou gavest him to be food to the folk inhabiting the wilderness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Thou didst cleave fountain and brook;  <paragraph-break/>Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Thine is the day, Thine also the night;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast established luminary and sun. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Thou hast set all the borders of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast made summer and winter. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>Remember this, how the enemy hath reproached the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And how a base people have blasphemed Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>O deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast;  <paragraph-break/>Forget not the life of Thy poor for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Look upon the covenant;  <paragraph-break/>For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>O let not the oppressed turn back in confusion;  <paragraph-break/>Let the poor and needy praise Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Arise, O God, plead Thine own cause;  
         <paragraph-break/>Remember Thy reproach all the day at the hand of the base man. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries,  <paragraph-break/>The tumult of those that rise up against Thee which ascendeth continually. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>75</chapter-number>For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>We give thanks unto Thee, O God,  <paragraph-break/>We give thanks, and Thy name is near;  <paragraph-break/>Men tell of Thy wondrous works. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>'When I take the appointed time,  <paragraph-break/>I Myself will judge with equity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>When the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved,  <paragraph-break/>I Myself establish the pillars of it.'  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I say unto the arrogant 'Deal not arrogantly';  <paragraph-break/>And to the wicked 'Lift not up the horn.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Lift not up your horn on high;  <paragraph-break/>Speak not insolence with a haughty neck. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For neither from the east, nor from the west,  <paragraph-break/>Nor yet from the wilderness, cometh lifting up. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>For God is judge;  <paragraph-break/>He putteth down one, and lifteth up another. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For in the hand of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> there is a cup, with foaming wine, full of mixture,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And He poureth out of the same;  <paragraph-break/>Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>But as for me, I will declare for ever,  <paragraph-break/>I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;  <paragraph-break/>But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>76</chapter-number>For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>In Judah is God known;  <paragraph-break/>His name is great in Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>In Salem also is set His tabernacle,  <paragraph-break/>And His dwelling-place in Zion. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow;  <paragraph-break/>The shield, and the sword, and the battle.                                    Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep;  <paragraph-break/>And none of the men of might have found their hands. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,  <paragraph-break/>They are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou, even Thou, art terrible;  
         <paragraph-break/>And who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven;  <paragraph-break/>The earth feared, and was still, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>When God arose to judgment,  <paragraph-break/>To save all the humble of the earth.  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee;  <paragraph-break/>The residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Vow, and pay unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God;  <paragraph-break/>Let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>He minisheth the spirit of princes;  <paragraph-break/>He is terrible to the kings of the earth. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>77</chapter-number>For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will lift up my voice unto God, an cry;  <paragraph-break/>I will lift up my voice unto God, that He may give ear unto me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;  <paragraph-break/>With my hand uplifted, [mine eye] streameth in the night without ceasing;  <paragraph-break/>My soul refuseth to be comforted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>When I think thereon, O God, I must moan;  <paragraph-break/>When I muse thereon, my spirit fainteth.                                Selah 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou holdest fast the lids of mine eyes;  <paragraph-break/>I am troubled, and cannot speak. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>In the night I will call to remembrance my song;  <paragraph-break/>I will commune with mine own heart;  <paragraph-break/>And my spirit maketh diligent search <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>'Will the Lord cast off for ever?  <paragraph-break/>And will He be favourable no more? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Is His mercy clean gone for ever?  <paragraph-break/>Is His promise come to an end for evermore? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Hath God forgotten to be gracious?  <paragraph-break/>Hath He in anger shut up his compassions?'                       Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And I say 'This is my weakness,  <paragraph-break/>That the right hand of the Most High could change. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>I will make mention of the deeds of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, I will remember Thy wonders of old. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>I will meditate also upon all Thy work,  <paragraph-break/>And muse on Thy doings.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>O God, Thy way is in holiness;  <paragraph-break/>Who is a great god like unto God? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Thou art the God that doest wonders;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people,  <paragraph-break/>The sons of Jacob and Joseph.  
         Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>The waters saw Thee, O God;  <paragraph-break/>The waters saw Thee, they were in pain;  <paragraph-break/>The depths also trembled. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>The clouds flooded forth waters;  <paragraph-break/>The skies sent out a sound;  <paragraph-break/>Thine arrows also went abroad. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind;  <paragraph-break/>The lightnings lighted up the world;  <paragraph-break/>The earth trembled and shook. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thy way was in the sea,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy path in the great waters,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy footsteps were not known. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock,  <paragraph-break/>By the hand of Moses and Aaron. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>78</chapter-number>Maschil of Asaph.   <paragraph-break/>Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;  <paragraph-break/>Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will open my mouth with a parable;  <paragraph-break/>I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>That which we have heard and known,  <paragraph-break/>And our fathers have told us, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>We will not hide from their children,  <paragraph-break/>Telling to the generation to come the praises of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For He established a testimony in Jacob,  <paragraph-break/>And appointed a law in Israel,  <paragraph-break/>Which He commanded our fathers,  <paragraph-break/>That they should make them known to their children; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born;  <paragraph-break/>Who should arise and tell them to their children, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>That they might put their confidence in God,  <paragraph-break/>And not forget the works of God,  <paragraph-break/>But keep His commandments; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And might not be as their fathers,  <paragraph-break/>A stubborn and rebellious generation;  <paragraph-break/>A generation that set not their heart aright,  <paragraph-break/>And whose spirit was not stedfast with God. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow,  <paragraph-break/>That turned back in the day of battle. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>They kept not the covenant of God,  <paragraph-break/>And refused to walk in His law; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And they forgot His doings,  <paragraph-break/>And His wondrous works that He had shown them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers,  <paragraph-break/>In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through;  
         <paragraph-break/>And He made the waters to stand as a heap. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>By day also He led them with a cloud,  <paragraph-break/>And all the night with a light of fire. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>He cleaved rocks in the wilderness,  <paragraph-break/>And gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>He brought streams also out of the rock,  <paragraph-break/>And caused waters to run down like rivers. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Yet went they on still to sin against Him,  <paragraph-break/>To rebel against the Most High in the desert. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>And they tried God in their heart  <paragraph-break/>By asking food for their craving. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Yea, they spoke against God;  <paragraph-break/>They said 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out,  <paragraph-break/>And streams overflowed;  <paragraph-break/>Can He give bread also?  <paragraph-break/>Or will He provide flesh for His people?' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Therefore the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> heard, and was wroth;  <paragraph-break/>And a fire was kindled against Jacob,  <paragraph-break/>And anger also went up against Israel; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Because they believed not in God,  <paragraph-break/>And trusted not in His salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>And He commanded the skies above,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And opened the doors of heaven; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And He caused manna to rain upon them for food,  <paragraph-break/>And gave them of the corn of heaven. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Man did eat the bread of the mighty;  <paragraph-break/>He sent them provisions to the full. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven;  <paragraph-break/>And by His power He brought on the south wind. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust,  <paragraph-break/>And winged fowl as the sand of the seas; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>And He let it fall in the midst of their camp,  <paragraph-break/>Round about their dwellings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>So they did eat, and were well filled;  <paragraph-break/>And He gave them that which they craved. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>They were not estranged from their craving,  <paragraph-break/>Their food was yet in their mouths, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>When the anger of God went up against them,  <paragraph-break/>And slew of the lustieth among them,  <paragraph-break/>And smote down the young men of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>For all this they sinned still,  <paragraph-break/>And believed not in His wondrous works. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>Therefore He ended their days as a breath,  <paragraph-break/>And their years in terror. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him,  <paragraph-break/>And turn back and seek God earnestly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>And they remembered that God was their Rock,  <paragraph-break/>And the Most High God their redeemer. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>But they beguiled Him with their mouth,  <paragraph-break/>And lied unto Him with their tongue. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>For their heart was not stedfast with Him,  <paragraph-break/>Neither were they faithful in His covenant. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>38</verse-number>But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away,  <paragraph-break/>And doth not stir up all His wrath. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>So He remembered that they were but flesh,  <paragraph-break/>A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>40</verse-number>How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness,  <paragraph-break/>And grieve Him in the desert! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>41</verse-number>And still again they tried God,  <paragraph-break/>And set bounds to the Holy One of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>42</verse-number>They remembered not His hand,  <paragraph-break/>Nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>43</verse-number>How He set His signs in Egypt,  <paragraph-break/>And His wonders in the field of Zoan; 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>44</verse-number>And turned their rivers into blood,  <paragraph-break/>So that they could not drink their streams. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>45</verse-number>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;  <paragraph-break/>And frogs, which destroyed them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>46</verse-number>He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar,  <paragraph-break/>And their labour unto the locust. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>47</verse-number>He destroyed their vines with hail,  <paragraph-break/>And their sycamore-trees with frost. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>48</verse-number>He gave over their cattle also to the hail,  <paragraph-break/>And their flocks to fiery bolts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>49</verse-number>He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger,  <paragraph-break/>Wrath, and indignation, and trouble,  <paragraph-break/>A sending of messengers of evil. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>50</verse-number>He levelled a path for His anger;  <paragraph-break/>He spared not their soul from death,  <paragraph-break/>But gave their life over to the pestilence; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>51</verse-number>And smote all the first-born in Egypt,  <paragraph-break/>The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>52</verse-number>But He made His own people to go forth like sheep,  <paragraph-break/>And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>53</verse-number>And He led them safely, and they feared not;  <paragraph-break/>But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>54</verse-number>And He brought them to His holy border,  <paragraph-break/>To the mountain, which His right hand had gotten. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>55</verse-number>He drove out the nations also before them,  <paragraph-break/>And allotted them for an inheritance by line,  <paragraph-break/>And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>56</verse-number>Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High,  <paragraph-break/>And kept not His testimonies; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>57</verse-number>But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers;  <paragraph-break/>They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>58</verse-number>For they provoked Him with their high places,  <paragraph-break/>And moved Him to jealousy with their graven images. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>59</verse-number>God heard, and was wroth,  <paragraph-break/>And He greatly abhorred Israel; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>60</verse-number>And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,  <paragraph-break/>The tent which He had made to dwell among men; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>61</verse-number>And delivered His strength into captivity,  <paragraph-break/>And His glory into the adversary's hand. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>62</verse-number>He gave His people over also unto the sword;  <paragraph-break/>And was wroth with His inheritance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>63</verse-number>Fire devoured their young men;  <paragraph-break/>And their virgins had no marriage-song. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>64</verse-number>Their priests fell by the sword;  <paragraph-break/>And their widows made no lamentation. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>65</verse-number>Then the Lord awaked as one asleep,  <paragraph-break/>Like a mighty man recovering from wine. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>66</verse-number>And He smote His adversaries backward;  <paragraph-break/>He put upon them a perpetual reproach. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>67</verse-number>Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph,  <paragraph-break/>And chose not the tribe of Ephraim; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>68</verse-number>But chose the tribe of Judah,  <paragraph-break/>The mount Zion which He loved. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>69</verse-number>And He built His sanctuary like the heights,  <paragraph-break/>Like the earth which He hath founded for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>70</verse-number>He chose David also His servant,  <paragraph-break/>And took him from the sheepfolds; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>71</verse-number>From following the ewes that give suck He brought him,  <paragraph-break/>To be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>72</verse-number>So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart;  <paragraph-break/>And lead them by the skilfulness of his hands. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>79</chapter-number>A Psalm of Asaph.   <paragraph-break/>O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance;  <paragraph-break/>They have defiled Thy holy temple;  <paragraph-break/>They have made Jerusalem into heaps. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven,  
         <paragraph-break/>The flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>They have shed their blood like water  <paragraph-break/>Round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>We are become a taunt to our neighbours,  <paragraph-break/>A scorn and derision to them that are round about us. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>How long, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, wilt Thou be angry for ever?  <paragraph-break/>How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not,  <paragraph-break/>And upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For they have devoured Jacob,  <paragraph-break/>And laid waste his habitation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers;  <paragraph-break/>Let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us;  <paragraph-break/>For we are brought very low. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name;  <paragraph-break/>And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their God?'  <paragraph-break/>Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed  <paragraph-break/>Be made known among the nations in our sight. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee;  <paragraph-break/>According to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom  <paragraph-break/>Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture  <paragraph-break/>Will give Thee thanks for ever;  <paragraph-break/>We will tell of Thy praise to all generations. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>80</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A testimony. A Psalm of Asaph.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,  <paragraph-break/>Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;  <paragraph-break/>Thou that art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy might,  <paragraph-break/>And come to save us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>O God, restore us;  <paragraph-break/>And cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> God of hosts,  <paragraph-break/>How long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy people? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears,  <paragraph-break/>And given them tears to drink in large measure. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours;  <paragraph-break/>And our enemies mock as they please. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>O God of hosts, restore us;  <paragraph-break/>And cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Thou didst pluck up a vine out of Egypt;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Thou didst clear a place before it,  <paragraph-break/>And it took deep root, and filled the land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The mountains were covered with the shadow of it,  <paragraph-break/>And the mighty cedars with the boughs thereof. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>She sent out her branches unto the sea,  <paragraph-break/>And her shoots unto the River. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Why hast Thou broken down her fences,  <paragraph-break/>So that all they that pass by the way do pluck her? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>The boar out of the wood doth ravage it,  <paragraph-break/>That which moveth in the field feedeth on it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>O God of hosts, return, we beseech Thee;  <paragraph-break/>Look from heaven, and behold, and be mindful of this vine, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And of the stock which Thy right hand hath planted,  <paragraph-break/>And the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>It is burned with fire, it is cut down;  <paragraph-break/>They perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand,  <paragraph-break/>Upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>So shall we not turn back from Thee;  <paragraph-break/>Quicken Thou us, and we will call upon Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> God of hosts, restore us;  <paragraph-break/>Cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>81</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon the Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Sing aloud unto God our strength;  <paragraph-break/>Shout unto the God of Jacob. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Take up the melody, and sound the timbrel,  <paragraph-break/>The sweet harp with the psaltery. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Blow the horn at the new moon,  <paragraph-break/>At the full moon for our feast-day. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For it is a statute for Israel,  <paragraph-break/>An ordinance of the God of Jacob. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony,  <paragraph-break/>When He went forth against the land of Egypt.  <paragraph-break/>The speech of one that I knew not did I hear: <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>'I removed his shoulder from the burden; His hands were freed from the basket. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou didst call in trouble, and I rescued thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Hear, O My people, and I will admonish thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto Me! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign god. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>But My people hearkened not to My voice;  <paragraph-break/>And Israel would none of Me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart,  <paragraph-break/>That they might walk in their own counsels. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Oh that My people would hearken unto Me,  <paragraph-break/>That Israel would walk in My ways! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>I would soon subdue their enemies,  <paragraph-break/>And turn My hand against their adversaries. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>The haters of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> should dwindle away before Him;  <paragraph-break/>And their punishment should endure for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>They should also be fed with the fat of wheat;  <paragraph-break/>And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.' <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <chapter-number>82</chapter-number>A Psalm of Asaph.   <paragraph-break/>God standeth in the congregation of God;  <paragraph-break/>In the midst of the judges He judgeth: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>'How long will ye judge unjustly,  <paragraph-break/>And respect the persons of the wicked?                                Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Judge the poor and fatherless;  <paragraph-break/>Do justice to the afflicted and destitute. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Rescue the poor and needy;  <paragraph-break/>Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>They know not, neither do they understand;  <paragraph-break/>They go about in darkness;  <paragraph-break/>All the foundations of the earth are moved. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>I said: Ye are godlike beings,  <paragraph-break/>And all of you sons of the Most High. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Nevertheless ye shall die like men,  <paragraph-break/>And fall like one of the princes.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>83</chapter-number>A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.   <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O God, keep not Thou silence;  <paragraph-break/>Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar;  <paragraph-break/>And they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>They hold crafty converse against Thy people,  <paragraph-break/>And take counsel against Thy treasured ones. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;  <paragraph-break/>That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>For they have consulted together with one consent;  <paragraph-break/>Against Thee do they make a covenant; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;  <paragraph-break/>Moab, and the Hagrites; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;  <paragraph-break/>Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Assyria also is joined with them;  <paragraph-break/>They have been an arm to the children of Lot.                     Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Do Thou unto them as unto Midian;  <paragraph-break/>As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Who were destroyed at En-dor;  <paragraph-break/>They became as dung for the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,  <paragraph-break/>And like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession  <paragraph-break/>The habitations of God.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>O my God, make them like the whirling dust;  <paragraph-break/>As stubble before the wind. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>As the fire that burneth the forest,

         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Fill their faces with shame;  <paragraph-break/>That they may seek Thy name, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>84</chapter-number>For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of hosts! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth for the courts of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>My heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself,  <paragraph-break/>Where she may lay her young;  <paragraph-break/>Thine altars, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of hosts,  <paragraph-break/>My King, and my God— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Happy are they that dwell in Thy house,  <paragraph-break/>They are ever praising Thee.    Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Happy is the man whose strength is in Thee;  <paragraph-break/>In whose heart are the highways. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs;  
         <paragraph-break/>Yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>They go from strength to strength,  <paragraph-break/>Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> God of hosts, hear my prayer;  <paragraph-break/>Give ear, O God of Jacob.        Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Behold, O God our shield,  <paragraph-break/>And look upon the face of Thine anointed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand;  <paragraph-break/>I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God,  <paragraph-break/>Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> God is a sun and a shield;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> giveth grace and glory;  <paragraph-break/>No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of hosts,  <paragraph-break/>Happy is the man that trusteth in Thee. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>85</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land,  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast turned the captivity of Jacob. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy people,  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast pardoned all their sin.  Selah 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Thou hast withdrawn all Thy wrath;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast turned from the fierceness of Thine anger. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Restore us, O God of our salvation,  <paragraph-break/>And cause Thine indignation toward us to cease. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever?  <paragraph-break/>Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to all generations? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Wilt Thou not quicken us again,  <paragraph-break/>That Thy people may rejoice in Thee? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Show us Thy mercy, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And grant us Thy salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>I will hear what God the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will speak;  <paragraph-break/>For He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints;  <paragraph-break/>But let them not turn back to folly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him;  <paragraph-break/>That glory may dwell in our land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Mercy and truth are met together;  <paragraph-break/>Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Truth springeth out of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>And righteousness hath looked down from heaven. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Yea, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will give that which is good;  <paragraph-break/>And our land shall yield her produce. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Righteousness shall go before Him,  <paragraph-break/>And shall make His footsteps a way. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>86</chapter-number>A Prayer of David.   <paragraph-break/>Incline Thine ear, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and answer me;  <paragraph-break/>For I am poor and needy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Keep my soul, for I am godly;  <paragraph-break/>O Thou my God, save Thy servant that trusteth in Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Be gracious unto me, O Lord;  <paragraph-break/>For unto Thee do I cry all the day. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Rejoice the soul of Thy servant;  <paragraph-break/>For unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to pardon,  <paragraph-break/>And plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Give ear, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, unto my prayer;  <paragraph-break/>And attend unto the voice of my supplications. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>In the day of my trouble I call upon Thee;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou wilt answer me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord,  <paragraph-break/>And there are no works like Thine. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and prostrate themselves before Thee, O Lord;  <paragraph-break/>And they shall glorify Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For Thou art great, and doest wondrous things;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art God alone. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Teach me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thy way, that I may walk in Thy truth;  <paragraph-break/>Make one my heart to fear Thy name. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>I will thank Thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart;  <paragraph-break/>And I will glorify Thy name for evermore. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For great is Thy mercy toward me;  <paragraph-break/>And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest nether-world. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>O God, the proud are risen up against me,  <paragraph-break/>And the company of violent men have sought after my soul,  <paragraph-break/>And have not set Thee before them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>But Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious,  <paragraph-break/>Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>O turn unto me, and be gracious unto me;  <paragraph-break/>Give Thy strength unto Thy servant,  <paragraph-break/>And save the son of Thy handmaid. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Work in my behalf a sign for good;  <paragraph-break/>That they that hate me may see it, and be put to shame,  <paragraph-break/>Because Thou, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hast helped me, and comforted me. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>87</chapter-number>A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>His foundation is in the holy mountains. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> loveth the gates of Zion  <paragraph-break/>More than all the dwellings of Jacob. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Glorious things are spoken of Thee,  <paragraph-break/>O city of God.                          Selah 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>'I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know Me;  <paragraph-break/>Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia;  <paragraph-break/>This one was born there.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>But of Zion it shall be said: 'This man and that was born in her;  <paragraph-break/>And the Most High Himself doth establish her.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall count in the register of the peoples:  <paragraph-break/>'This one was born there.'         Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And whether they sing or dance,  <paragraph-break/>All my thoughts are in Thee. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, God of my salvation,  <paragraph-break/>What time I cry in the night before Thee, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Let my prayer come before Thee,  <paragraph-break/>Incline Thine ear unto my cry. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For my soul is sated with troubles,  <paragraph-break/>And my life draweth nigh unto the grave. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I am counted with them that go down into the pit;  <paragraph-break/>I am become as a man that hath no help; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Set apart among the dead,  <paragraph-break/>Like the slain that lie in the grave,  <paragraph-break/>Whom Thou rememberest no more;  <paragraph-break/>And they are cut off from Thy hand. <paragraph-break/>
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Thou hast laid me in the nether-most pit,  <paragraph-break/>In dark places, in the deeps. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,  <paragraph-break/>And all Thy waves Thou pressest down.                                    Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast made me an abomination unto them;  <paragraph-break/>I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction;  <paragraph-break/>I have called upon Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, every day,  <paragraph-break/>I have spread forth my hands unto Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead?  <paragraph-break/>Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks?                        Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave?  <paragraph-break/>Or Thy faithfulness in destruction? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark?  <paragraph-break/>And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>But as for me, unto Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, do I cry,  <paragraph-break/>And in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, why castest Thou off my soul?  <paragraph-break/>Why hidest Thou Thy face from me? 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up;  <paragraph-break/>I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Thy fierce wrath is gone over me;  <paragraph-break/>Thy terrors have cut me off. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>They came round about me like water all the day;  <paragraph-break/>They compassed me about together. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Friend and companion hast Thou put far from me,  <paragraph-break/>And mine acquaintance into darkness. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will sing of the mercies of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for ever;  <paragraph-break/>To all generations will I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>So shall the heavens praise Thy wonders, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For who in the skies can be compared unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Who among the sons of might can be likened unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Thou rulest the proud swelling of the sea;  <paragraph-break/>When the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Thou didst crush Rahab, as one that is slain;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst scattered Thine enemies with the arm of Thy strength. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Thine are the heavens, Thine also the earth;  <paragraph-break/>The world and the fulness thereof, Thou hast founded them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>The north and the south, Thou hast created them;  <paragraph-break/>Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Thine is an arm with might;  <paragraph-break/>Strong is Thy hand, and exalted is Thy right hand. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Thy throne;  <paragraph-break/>Mercy and truth go before Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Happy is the people that know the joyful shout;  <paragraph-break/>They walk, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in the light of Thy countenance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>In Thy name do they rejoice all the day;  
         <paragraph-break/>And through Thy righteousness are they exalted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>For Thou art the glory of their strength;  <paragraph-break/>And in Thy favour our horn is exalted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>For of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is our shield;  <paragraph-break/>And the Holy One of Israel is our king. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Then Thou spokest in vision to Thy godly ones,  <paragraph-break/>And saidst: 'I have laid help upon one that is mighty;  <paragraph-break/>I have exalted one chosen out of the people. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>I have found David My servant;  <paragraph-break/>With My holy oil have I anointed him; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>With whom My hand shall be established;  <paragraph-break/>Mine arm also shall strengthen him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>The enemy shall not exact from him;  <paragraph-break/>Nor the son of wickedness afflict him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And I will beat to pieces his adversaries before him,  <paragraph-break/>And smite them that hate him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him;  <paragraph-break/>And through My name shall his horn be exalted. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>I will set his hand also on the sea,  <paragraph-break/>And his right hand on the rivers. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>He shall call unto Me: Thou art my Father,  <paragraph-break/>My God, and the rock of my salvation. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>I also will appoint him first-born,  <paragraph-break/>The highest of the kings of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>For ever will I keep for him My mercy,  <paragraph-break/>And My covenant shall stand fast with him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>His seed also will I make to endure for ever,  <paragraph-break/>And his throne as the days of heaven. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>If his children forsake My law,  <paragraph-break/>And walk not in Mine ordinances; <paragraph-break/>
         <small-caps> :32</small-caps>If they profane My statutes,  <paragraph-break/>And keep not My commandments; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,  <paragraph-break/>And their iniquity with strokes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>But My mercy will I not break off from him,  <paragraph-break/>Nor will I be false to My faithfulness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>My covenant will I not profane,  <paragraph-break/>Nor alter that which is gone out of My lips. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>Once have I sworn by My holiness:  <paragraph-break/>Surely I will not be false unto David; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>His seed shall endure for ever,  <paragraph-break/>And his throne as the sun before Me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>38</verse-number>It shall be established for ever as the moon;  <paragraph-break/>And be stedfast as the witness in sky.'                                      Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>But Thou hast cast off and rejected,  
         <paragraph-break/>Thou hast been wroth with Thine anointed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>40</verse-number>Thou hast abhorred the covenant of Thy servant;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast profaned his crown even to the ground. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>41</verse-number>Thou hast broken down all his fences;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>42</verse-number>All that pass by the way spoil him;  <paragraph-break/>He is become a taunt to his neighbours. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>43</verse-number>Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>44</verse-number>Yea, Thou turnest back the edge of his sword,  <paragraph-break/>And hast not made him to stand in the battle. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>45</verse-number>Thou hast made his brightness to cease,  <paragraph-break/>And cast his throne down to the ground. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>46</verse-number>The days of his youth hast Thou shortened;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast covered him with shame.  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>47</verse-number>How long, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, wilt Thou hide Thyself for ever?  <paragraph-break/>How long shall Thy wrath burn like fire? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>48</verse-number>O remember how short my time is;  <paragraph-break/>For what vanity hast Thou created all the children of men! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>49</verse-number>What man is he that liveth and shall not see death,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>That shall deliver his soul from the power of the grave?              Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>50</verse-number>Where are Thy former mercies, O Lord,  <paragraph-break/>Which Thou didst swear unto David in Thy faithfulness? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>51</verse-number>Remember, Lord, the taunt of Thy servants;  <paragraph-break/>How I do bear in my bosom [the taunt of] so many peoples; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>52</verse-number>Wherewith Thine enemies have taunted, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Wherewith they have taunted the footsteps of Thine anointed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>53</verse-number>Blessed be the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for evermore.  <paragraph-break/>Amen, and Amen.  <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>90</chapter-number>A Prayer of Moses the man of God.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Before the mountains were brought forth,  <paragraph-break/>Or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world,  <paragraph-break/>Even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou turnest man to contrition;  <paragraph-break/>And sayest: 'Return, ye children of men.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For a thousand years in Thy sight  <paragraph-break/>Are but as yesterday when it is past,  <paragraph-break/>And as a watch in the night. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep;  <paragraph-break/>In the morning they are like grass which groweth up. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;  <paragraph-break/>In the evening it is cut down, and withereth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For we are consumed in Thine anger,  <paragraph-break/>And by Thy wrath are we hurried away. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee,  <paragraph-break/>Our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For all our days are passed away in Thy wrath;  <paragraph-break/>We bring our years to an end as a tale that is told. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>The days of our years are threescore years and ten,  <paragraph-break/>Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;  <paragraph-break/>Yet is their pride but travail and vanity;  <paragraph-break/>For it is speedily gone, and we fly away. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Who knoweth the power of Thine anger,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto Thee? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>So teach us to number our days,  <paragraph-break/>That we may get us a heart of wisdom. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Return, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; how long?  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And let it repent Thee concerning Thy servants. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>O satisfy us in the morning with Thy mercy;  <paragraph-break/>That we may rejoice and be glad all our days. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Make us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us,  <paragraph-break/>According to the years wherein we have seen evil. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy glory upon their children. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>And let the graciousness of the Lord our God be upon us;  <paragraph-break/>Establish Thou also upon us the work of our hands;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, the work of our hands establish Thou it. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>91</chapter-number>O thou that dwellest in the  covert of the Most High,  <paragraph-break/>And abidest in the shadow of the Almighty; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will say of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, who is my refuge and my fortress,  <paragraph-break/>My God, in whom I trust, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>That He will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,  <paragraph-break/>And from the noisome pestilence. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>He will cover thee with His pinions,  <paragraph-break/>And under His wings shalt thou take refuge;  <paragraph-break/>His truth is a shield and a buckler. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night,  
         <paragraph-break/>Nor of the arrow that flieth by day; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Of the pestilence that walketh in darkness,  <paragraph-break/>Nor of the destruction that wasteth at noonday. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>A thousand may fall at Thy side,  <paragraph-break/>And ten thousand at Thy right hand;  <paragraph-break/>It shall not come nigh thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold,  <paragraph-break/>And see the recompense of the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For thou hast made the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who is my refuge,  <paragraph-break/>Even the Most High, thy habitation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>There shall no evil befall thee,  <paragraph-break/>Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>For He will give His angels charge over thee,  <paragraph-break/>To keep thee in all thy ways. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>They shall bear thee upon their hands,  <paragraph-break/>Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and asp;  <paragraph-break/>The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>'Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him;  <paragraph-break/>I will set him on high, because he hath known My name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>I will be with him in trouble;  <paragraph-break/>I will rescue him, and bring him to honour. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>With long life will I satisfy him,  <paragraph-break/>And make Him to behold My salvation.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>92</chapter-number>A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy faithfulness in the night seasons, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery;  <paragraph-break/>With a solemn sound upon the harp. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For Thou, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hast made me glad through Thy work;  <paragraph-break/>I will exult in the works of Thy hands. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>How great are Thy works, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>!  <paragraph-break/>Thy thoughts are very deep. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>A brutish man knoweth not,  <paragraph-break/>Neither doth a fool understand this. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>When the wicked spring up as the grass,  <paragraph-break/>And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;  <paragraph-break/>It is that they may be destroyed for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>But Thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, art on high for evermore. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For, lo, Thine enemies, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>For, lo, Thine enemies shall perish:  <paragraph-break/>All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>But my horn hast Thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox;  <paragraph-break/>I am anointed with rich oil. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Mine eye also hath gazed on them that lie in wait for me,  <paragraph-break/>Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree;  <paragraph-break/>He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Planted in the house of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>They shall flourish in the courts of our God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;  <paragraph-break/>They shall be full of sap and richness; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>To declare that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is upright,  <paragraph-break/>My Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>93</chapter-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> reigneth; He is  clothed in majesty;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, the world is established, that it cannot be moved. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Thy throne is established of old;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art from everlasting. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The floods have lifted up, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>The floods have lifted up their voice;  <paragraph-break/>The floods lift up their roaring. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Above the voices of many waters,  <paragraph-break/>The mighty breakers of the sea,  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> on high is mighty. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thy testimonies are very sure,  <paragraph-break/>Holiness becometh Thy house,  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for evermore. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>94</chapter-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou God to whom  vengeance belongeth,  <paragraph-break/>Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Lift up Thyself, Thou Judge of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>Render to the proud their recompense. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, how long shall the wicked,  <paragraph-break/>How long shall the wicked exult? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>They gush out, they speak arrogancy;  <paragraph-break/>All the workers of iniquity bear themselves loftily. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>They crush Thy people, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And afflict Thy heritage. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>They slay the widow and the stranger,  <paragraph-break/>And murder the fatherless. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And they say: 'The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will not see,  <paragraph-break/>Neither will the God of Jacob give heed.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Consider, ye brutish among the people;  
         <paragraph-break/>And ye fools, when will ye understand? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>He that planted the ear, shall He not hear?  <paragraph-break/>He that formed the eye, shall He not see? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>He that instructeth nations, shall not He correct?  <paragraph-break/>Even He that teacheth man knowledge? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> knoweth the thoughts of man,  <paragraph-break/>That they are vanity. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Happy is the man whom Thou instructest, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And teachest out of Thy law; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>That Thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil,  <paragraph-break/>Until the pit be digged for the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will not cast off His people,  <paragraph-break/>Neither will He forsake His inheritance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>For right shall return unto justice,  <paragraph-break/>And all the upright in heart shall follow it. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?  <paragraph-break/>Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Unless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> had been my help,  <paragraph-break/>My soul had soon dwelt in silence. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>If I say: 'My foot slippeth',  <paragraph-break/>Thy mercy, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, holdeth me up. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>When my cares are many within me,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Thy comforts delight my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Shall the seat of wickedness have fellowship with Thee,  <paragraph-break/>Which frameth mischief by statute? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,  <paragraph-break/>And condemn innocent blood. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath been my high tower,  <paragraph-break/>And my God the rock of my refuge. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>And He hath brought upon them their own iniquity,  <paragraph-break/>And will cut them off in their own evil;  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God will cut them off. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>95</chapter-number>O come, let us sing unto the  <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>Let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving,  <paragraph-break/>Let us shout for joy unto Him with psalms. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is a great God,  <paragraph-break/>And a great King above all gods; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>In whose hand are the depths of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>The heights of the mountains are His also. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>The sea is His, and He made it;  <paragraph-break/>And His hands formed the dry land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>O come, let us bow down and bend the knee;  <paragraph-break/>Let us kneel before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our Maker; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>For He is our God,  
         <paragraph-break/>And we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand.  <paragraph-break/>To-day, if ye would but hearken to His voice! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>'Harden not your heart, as at Meribah,  <paragraph-break/>As in the day of Massah in the wilderness; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>When your fathers tried Me,  <paragraph-break/>Proved Me, even though they saw My work. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For forty years was I wearied with that generation,  <paragraph-break/>And said: It is a people that do err in their heart,  <paragraph-break/>And they have not known My ways; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Wherefore I swore in My wrath,  <paragraph-break/>That they should not enter into My <note mark="a" id="note-1018-a"> See Deut. xii, 9. </note>rest.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>96</chapter-number>O sing unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> a new  song;  <paragraph-break/>Sing unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Sing unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, bless His name;  <paragraph-break/>Proclaim His salvation from day to day. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Declare His glory among the nations,  <paragraph-break/>His marvellous works among all the peoples. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For great is the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and highly to be praised;  <paragraph-break/>He is to be feared above all gods. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought;  <paragraph-break/>But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made the heavens. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Honour and majesty are before Him;  <paragraph-break/>Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Ascribe unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, ye kindreds of the peoples,  <paragraph-break/>Ascribe unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> glory and strength. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Ascribe unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> the glory due unto His name;  <paragraph-break/>Bring an offering, and come into His courts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>O worship the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in the beauty of holiness;  <paragraph-break/>Tremble before Him, all the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Say among the nations: 'The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> reigneth.'  <paragraph-break/>The world also is established that it cannot be moved;  <paragraph-break/>He will judge the peoples with equity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;  <paragraph-break/>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Let the field exult; and all that is therein;  <paragraph-break/>Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for He is come;  <paragraph-break/>For He is come to judge the earth;  <paragraph-break/>He will judge the world with righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And the peoples in His faithfulness. 
         <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>97</chapter-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> reigneth; let the  earth rejoice;  <paragraph-break/>Let the multitude of isles be glad. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Clouds and darkness are round about Him;  <paragraph-break/>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>A fire goeth before Him,  <paragraph-break/>And burneth up His adversaries round about. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>His lightnings lighted up the world;  <paragraph-break/>The earth saw, and trembled. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The heavens declared His righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And all the peoples saw His glory. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Ashamed be all they that serve graven images,  <paragraph-break/>That boast themselves of things of nought;  <paragraph-break/>Bow down to Him, all ye gods. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Zion heard and was glad,  <paragraph-break/>And the daughters of Judah rejoiced;  <paragraph-break/>Because of Thy judgments, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For Thou, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, art most high above all the earth;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art exalted far above all gods. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>O ye that love the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hate evil;  <paragraph-break/>He preserveth the souls of His saints;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>He delivered them out of the hand of the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Light is sown for the righteous,  <paragraph-break/>And gladness for the upright in heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Be glad in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, ye righteous;  <paragraph-break/>And give thanks to His holy name. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>98</chapter-number>A Psalm.   <paragraph-break/>O sing unto the  <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> a new song;  <paragraph-break/>For He hath done marvellous things;  <paragraph-break/>His right hand, and His holy arm, hath wrought salvation for Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath made known His salvation;  <paragraph-break/>His righteousness hath He revealed in the sight of the nations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>He hath remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel;  <paragraph-break/>All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Shout unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all the earth;  <paragraph-break/>Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Sing praises unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> with the harp;  <paragraph-break/>With the harp and the voice of melody. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>With trumpets and sound of the horn  <paragraph-break/>Shout ye before the King, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;  <paragraph-break/>The world, and they that dwell therein;

         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for He is come to judge the earth;  <paragraph-break/>He will judge the world with righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And the peoples with equity. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>99</chapter-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> reigneth; let the  peoples tremble;  <paragraph-break/>He is enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is great in Zion;  <paragraph-break/>And He is high above all the peoples. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Let them praise Thy name as great and awful;  <paragraph-break/>Holy is He. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The strength also of the king who loveth justice— <paragraph-break/>Thou hast established equity,  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Exalt ye the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God,  <paragraph-break/>And prostrate yourselves at His footstool;  <paragraph-break/>Holy is He. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Moses and Aaron among His priests,  <paragraph-break/>And Samuel among them that call upon His name,  <paragraph-break/>Did call upon the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and He answered them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>They kept His testimonies, and the statute that He gave them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God, Thou didst answer them;  <paragraph-break/>A forgiving God wast Thou unto them,  <paragraph-break/>Though Thou tookest vengeance of their misdeeds. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Exalt ye the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God,  <paragraph-break/>And worship at His holy hill;  <paragraph-break/>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God is holy. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>100</chapter-number>A Psalm of thanksgiving.   <paragraph-break/>Shout unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Serve the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> with gladness;  <paragraph-break/>Come before His presence with singing. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Know ye that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> He is God;  <paragraph-break/>It is He that hath made us, and we are His,  <paragraph-break/>His people, and the flock of His pasture. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is good; His mercy endureth for ever;  <paragraph-break/>And His faithfulness unto all generations. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>101</chapter-number>A Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>I will sing of mercy and justice;  <paragraph-break/>Unto Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, will I sing praises. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will give heed unto the way of integrity;  <paragraph-break/>Oh when wilt Thou come unto me?  <paragraph-break/>I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>I will set no base thing before mine eyes;  <paragraph-break/>I hate the doing of things crooked; it shall not cleave unto me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>A perverse heart shall depart from me;  <paragraph-break/>I will know no evil thing. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Whoso slandereth his neighbour in secret, him will I destroy;  <paragraph-break/>Whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me;  <paragraph-break/>He that walketh in a way of integrity, he shall minister unto me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house;  <paragraph-break/>He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land;  <paragraph-break/>To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>102</chapter-number>A Prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hear my prayer,  <paragraph-break/>And let my cry come unto Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress;  <paragraph-break/>Incline Thine ear unto me;  <paragraph-break/>In the day when I call answer me speedily. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For my days are consumed like smoke,  <paragraph-break/>And my bones are burned as a hearth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>My heart is smitten like grass, and withered;  <paragraph-break/>For I forget to eat my bread. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>By reason of the voice of my sighing  <paragraph-break/>My bones cleave to my flesh. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>I am like a pelican of the wilderness;  <paragraph-break/>I am become as an owl of the waste places. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>I watch, and am become  <paragraph-break/>Like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Mine enemies taunt me all the day;  <paragraph-break/>They that are mad against me do curse by me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For I have eaten ashes like bread,  <paragraph-break/>And mingled my drink with weeping, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>My days are like a lengthening shadow;  <paragraph-break/>And I am withered like grass. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>But Thou, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, sittest enthroned for ever;  <paragraph-break/>And Thy name is unto all generations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Thou wilt arise, and have compassion upon Zion;  <paragraph-break/>For it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones,  <paragraph-break/>And love her dust. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>So the nations will fear the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And all the kings of the earth Thy glory; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>When the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath built up Zion,  <paragraph-break/>When He hath appeared in His glory; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute,  <paragraph-break/>And hath not despised their prayer. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>This shall be written for the generation to come;  <paragraph-break/>And a people which shall be created shall praise the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary;  <paragraph-break/>From heaven did the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> behold the earth; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>To hear the groaning of the prisoner;  <paragraph-break/>To loose those that are appointed to death; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>That men may tell of the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in Zion,  <paragraph-break/>And His praise in Jerusalem; 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>When the peoples are gathered together,  <paragraph-break/>And the kingdoms, to serve the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>He weakened my strength in the way;  <paragraph-break/>He shortened my days. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>I say: 'O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days,  <paragraph-break/>Thou whose years endure throughout all generations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>And the heavens are the work of Thy hands. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;  <paragraph-break/>As a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>But Thou art the selfsame,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy years shall have no end. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely,  <paragraph-break/>And their seed shall be established before Thee.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>103</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of David.   <paragraph-break/>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O my soul;  <paragraph-break/>And all that is within me, bless His holy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O my soul,  <paragraph-break/>And forget not all His benefits; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Who forgiveth all thine iniquity;  <paragraph-break/>Who healeth all Thy diseases; 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Who redeemeth Thy life from the pit;  <paragraph-break/>Who encompasseth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Who satisfieth thine old age with good things;  <paragraph-break/>So that Thy youth is renewed like the eagle. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> executeth righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>And acts of justice for all that are oppressed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He made known His ways unto Moses,  <paragraph-break/>His doings unto the children of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is full of compassion and gracious,  <paragraph-break/>Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>He will not always contend;  <paragraph-break/>Neither will He keep His anger for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>He hath not dealt with us after our sins,  <paragraph-break/>Nor requited us according to our iniquities. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>For as the heaven is high above the earth,  <paragraph-break/>So great is His mercy toward them that fear Him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>As far as the east is from the west,  <paragraph-break/>So far hath He removed our transgressions from us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Like as a father hath compassion upon his children,  <paragraph-break/>So hath the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> compassion upon them that fear Him. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>For He knoweth our frame;  <paragraph-break/>He remembereth that we are dust. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>As for man, his days are as grass;  <paragraph-break/>As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;  <paragraph-break/>And the place thereof knoweth it no more. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>But the mercy of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him,  <paragraph-break/>And His righteousness unto children's children; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>To such as keep His covenant,  <paragraph-break/>And to those that remember His precepts to do them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath established His throne in the heavens;  <paragraph-break/>And His kingdom ruleth over all. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, ye angels of His,  <paragraph-break/>Ye mighty in strength, that fulfil His word,  <paragraph-break/>Hearkening unto the voice of His word. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all ye His hosts;  <paragraph-break/>Ye ministers of His, that do His pleasure. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all ye His works,  <paragraph-break/>In all places of His dominion;  <paragraph-break/>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O my soul. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>104</chapter-number>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O my  soul.  <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God, Thou art very great;  <paragraph-break/>Thou art clothed with glory and majesty. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment,  <paragraph-break/>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters,  <paragraph-break/>Who makest the clouds Thy chariot,  <paragraph-break/>Who walkest upon the wings of the wind; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Who makest winds Thy messengers,  <paragraph-break/>The flaming fire Thy ministers. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations,  <paragraph-break/>That it should not be moved for ever and ever; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture;  <paragraph-break/>The waters stood above the mountains. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>At Thy rebuke they fled,  <paragraph-break/>At the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The mountains rose, the valleys sank down— <paragraph-break/>Unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass over,  <paragraph-break/>That they might not return to cover the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Who sendest forth springs into the valleys;  <paragraph-break/>They run between the mountains; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>They give drink to every beast of the field,  <paragraph-break/>The wild asses quench their thirst. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Beside them dwell the fowl of the heaven,  <paragraph-break/>From among the branches they sing. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Who waterest the mountains from Thine upper chambers;  <paragraph-break/>The earth is full of the fruit of Thy works. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Who causeth the grass to spring up for the cattle,  <paragraph-break/>And herb for the service of man;  <paragraph-break/>To bring forth bread out of the earth, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,  <paragraph-break/>Making the face brighter than oil,  <paragraph-break/>And bread that stayeth man's heart. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>The trees of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> have their fill,  <paragraph-break/>The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Wherein the birds make their nests;  <paragraph-break/>As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>The high mountains are for the wild goats;  <paragraph-break/>The rocks are a refuge for the conies. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Who appointedst the moon for seasons;  <paragraph-break/>The sun knoweth his going down. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thou makest darkness, and it is night,  <paragraph-break/>Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>The young lions roar after their prey,  <paragraph-break/>And seek their food from God. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>The sun ariseth, they slink away,  <paragraph-break/>And couch in their dens. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Man goeth forth unto his work  <paragraph-break/>And to his labour until the evening. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>How manifold are Thy works, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>!  <paragraph-break/>In wisdom hast Thou made them all;  <paragraph-break/>The earth is full of Thy creatures. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Yonder sea, great and wide,  <paragraph-break/>Therein are creeping things innumerable,  <paragraph-break/>Living creatures, both small and great. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>There go the ships;  <paragraph-break/>There is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>All of them wait for Thee,  <paragraph-break/>That Thou mayest give them their food in due season. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>Thou givest it unto them, they gather it;  <paragraph-break/>Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish;  <paragraph-break/>Thou withdrawest their breath, they perish,  <paragraph-break/>And return to their dust. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created;  <paragraph-break/>And Thou renewest the face of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>May the glory of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> endure for ever;  <paragraph-break/>Let the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> rejoice in His works! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>I will sing unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> as long as I live;  <paragraph-break/>I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>Let my musing be sweet unto Him;  <paragraph-break/>As for me, I will rejoice in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>Let sinners cease out of the earth,  <paragraph-break/>And let the wicked be no more.  <paragraph-break/>Bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, O my soul.  <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>105</chapter-number>O give thanks unto the  <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, call upon His        name;  <paragraph-break/>Make known His doings among the peoples. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him;  <paragraph-break/>Speak ye of all His marvellous works. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Glory ye in His holy name;  <paragraph-break/>Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Seek ye the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> and His strength;  <paragraph-break/>Seek His face continually. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Remember His marvellous works that He hath done,  <paragraph-break/>His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>O ye seed of Abraham His servant,  <paragraph-break/>Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He is the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God;  
         <paragraph-break/>His judgments are in all the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>He hath remembered His covenant for ever,  <paragraph-break/>The word which He commanded to a thousand generations; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>[The covenant] which He made with Abraham,  <paragraph-break/>And His oath unto Isaac; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>And He established it unto Jacob for a statute,  <paragraph-break/>To Israel for an everlasting covenant; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,  <paragraph-break/>The lot of your inheritance.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>When they were but a few men in number.  <paragraph-break/>Yea, very few, and sojourners in it, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>And when they went about from nation to nation,  <paragraph-break/>From one kingdom to another people, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>He suffered no man to do them wrong,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, for their sake He reproved kings: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>'Touch not Mine anointed ones,  <paragraph-break/>And do My prophets no harm.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And He called a famine upon the land;  <paragraph-break/>He broke the whole staff of bread. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>He sent a man before them;  <paragraph-break/>Joseph was sold for a servant; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>His feet they hurt with fetters,  <paragraph-break/>His person was laid in iron; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Until the time that his word came to pass,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>The word of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> tested him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>The king sent and loosed him;  <paragraph-break/>Even the ruler of the peoples, and set him free. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>He made him lord of his house,  <paragraph-break/>And ruler of all his possessions; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>To bind his princes at his pleasure,  <paragraph-break/>And teach his elders wisdom. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Israel also came into Egypt;  <paragraph-break/>And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And He increased His people greatly,  <paragraph-break/>And made them too mighty for their adversaries. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>He turned their heart to hate His people,  <paragraph-break/>To deal craftily with His servants. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>He sent Moses His servant,  <paragraph-break/>And Aaron whom He had chosen. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>They wrought among them His manifold signs,  <paragraph-break/>And wonders in the land of Ham. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>He sent darkness, and it was dark;  <paragraph-break/>And they rebelled not against His word. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>He turned their waters into blood,  <paragraph-break/>And slew their fish. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>Their land swarmed with frogs,  <paragraph-break/>In the chambers of their kings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,  <paragraph-break/>And gnats in all their borders. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>He gave them hail for rain,  <paragraph-break/>And flaming fire in their land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>He smote their vines also and their fig-trees;  <paragraph-break/>And broke the trees of their borders. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>He spoke, and the locust came,  <paragraph-break/>And the canker-worm without number, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>And did eat up every herb in their land,  <paragraph-break/>And did eat up the fruit of their ground. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>He smote also all the first-born in their land,  <paragraph-break/>The first-fruits of all their strength. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>And He brought them forth with silver and gold;  <paragraph-break/>And there was none that stumbled among His tribes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>38</verse-number>Egypt was glad when they departed;  <paragraph-break/>For the fear of them had fallen upon them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>He spread a cloud for a screen;  <paragraph-break/>And fire to give light in the night. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>40</verse-number>They asked, and He brought quails,  <paragraph-break/>And gave them in plenty the bread of heaven. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>41</verse-number>He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;  <paragraph-break/>They ran, a river in the dry places. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>42</verse-number>For He remembered His holy word  <paragraph-break/>Unto Abraham His servant; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>43</verse-number>And He brought forth His people with joy,  <paragraph-break/>His chosen ones with singing. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>44</verse-number>And He gave them the lands of the nations,  <paragraph-break/>And they took the labour of the peoples in possession; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>45</verse-number>That they might keep His statutes,  <paragraph-break/>And observe His laws.  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Hallelujah. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>106</chapter-number>Hallelujah.  O give thanks unto the       <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; for He is good;  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Who can express the mighty acts of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Or make all His praise to be heard? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Happy are they that keep justice,  <paragraph-break/>That do righteousness at all times. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Remember me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, when Thou favourest Thy people;  <paragraph-break/>O think of me at Thy salvation; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>That I may behold the prosperity of Thy chosen,  <paragraph-break/>That I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation,  <paragraph-break/>That I may glory with Thine inheritance. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>We have sinned with our fathers,  <paragraph-break/>We have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders;  <paragraph-break/>They remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies;  <paragraph-break/>But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake,  <paragraph-break/>That He might make His mighty power to be known. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up;  <paragraph-break/>And He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them,  <paragraph-break/>And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And the waters covered their adversaries;  <paragraph-break/>There was not one of them left. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Then believed they His words;  <paragraph-break/>They sang His praise. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>They soon forgot His works;  <paragraph-break/>They waited not for His counsel; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,  <paragraph-break/>And tried God in the desert. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>And He gave them their request;  <paragraph-break/>But sent leanness into their soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>They were jealous also of Moses in the camp,  <paragraph-break/>And of Aaron the holy one of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,  <paragraph-break/>And covered the company of Abiram. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>And a fire was kindled in their company;  <paragraph-break/>The flame burned up the wicked. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>They made a calf in Horeb,  <paragraph-break/>And worshipped a molten image. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thus they exchanged their glory  <paragraph-break/>For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>They forgot God their saviour,  <paragraph-break/>Who had done great things in Egypt; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>Wondrous works in the land of Ham,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Terrible things by the Red Sea. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Therefore He said that He would destroy them,  <paragraph-break/>Had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach,  <paragraph-break/>To turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>Moreover, they scorned the desirable land,  <paragraph-break/>They believed not His word; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>And they murmured in their tents,  <paragraph-break/>They hearkened not unto the voice of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>Therefore He swore concerning them,  <paragraph-break/>That He would overthrow them in the wilderness; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>And that He would cast out their seed among the nations,  <paragraph-break/>And scatter them in the lands. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor,  <paragraph-break/>And ate the sacrifices of the dead. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>Thus they provoked Him with their doings,  <paragraph-break/>And the plague broke in upon them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>Then stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment,  <paragraph-break/>And so the plague was stayed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>And that was counted unto him for righteousness,  <paragraph-break/>Unto all generations for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah,  <paragraph-break/>And it went ill with Moses because of them; 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>For they embittered his spirit,  <paragraph-break/>And he spoke rashly with his lips. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>They did not destroy the peoples,  <paragraph-break/>As the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded them; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>But mingled themselves with the nations,  <paragraph-break/>And learned their works; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>And they served their idols,  <paragraph-break/>Which became a snare unto them; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>38</verse-number>And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,  <paragraph-break/>Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;  <paragraph-break/>And the land was polluted with blood. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>Thus were they defiled with their works,  <paragraph-break/>And went astray in their doings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>40</verse-number>Therefore was the wrath of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> kindled against His people,  <paragraph-break/>And He abhorred His inheritance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>41</verse-number>And He gave them into the hand of the nations;  <paragraph-break/>And they that hated them ruled over them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>42</verse-number>Their enemies also oppressed them,  <paragraph-break/>And they were subdued under their hand. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>43</verse-number>Many times did He deliver them;  <paragraph-break/>But they were rebellious in their counsel,  <paragraph-break/>And sank low through their iniquity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>44</verse-number>Nevertheless He looked upon their distress,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>When He heard their cry; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>45</verse-number>And He remembered for them His covenant,  <paragraph-break/>And repented according to the multitude of His mercies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>46</verse-number>He made them also to be pitied  <paragraph-break/>Of all those that carried them captive. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>47</verse-number>Save us, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God,  <paragraph-break/>And gather us from among the nations,  <paragraph-break/>That we may give thanks unto Thy holy name,  <paragraph-break/>That we may triumph in Thy praise. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>48</verse-number>Blessed be the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the God of Israel,  <paragraph-break/>From everlasting even to everlasting,  <paragraph-break/>And let all the people say: 'Amen.' Hallelujah.  <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>107</chapter-number>'O give thanks unto the  <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for He is good,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>So let the redeemed of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> say,  <paragraph-break/>Whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>And gathered them out of the lands,  <paragraph-break/>From the east and from the west,  <paragraph-break/>From the north and from the sea. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;  <paragraph-break/>They found no city of habitation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Hungry and thirsty,  <paragraph-break/>Their soul fainted in them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Then they cried unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in their trouble,  <paragraph-break/>And He delivered them out of their distresses. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,  <paragraph-break/>Being bound in affliction and iron— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Because they rebelled against the words of God,  <paragraph-break/>And contemned the counsel of the Most High. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Therefore He humbled their heart with travail,  <paragraph-break/>They stumbled, and there was none to help— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>They cried unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in their trouble,  <paragraph-break/>And He saved them out of their distresses. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,  <paragraph-break/>And broke their bands in sunder.

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Crazed because of the way of their transgression,  <paragraph-break/>And afflicted because of their iniquities— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>Their soul abhorred all manner of food,  <paragraph-break/>And they drew near unto the gates of death— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>They cried unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in their trouble,  <paragraph-break/>And He saved them out of their distresses; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>He sent His word, and healed them,  <paragraph-break/>And delivered them from their graves. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>24</verse-number>These saw the works of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And His wonders in the deep; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>For He commanded, and raised the stormy wind,  
         <paragraph-break/>Which lifted up the waves thereof; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps;  <paragraph-break/>Their soul melted away because of trouble; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man,  <paragraph-break/>And all their wisdom was swallowed up— <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>They cried unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in their trouble,  <paragraph-break/>And He brought them out of their distresses. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>He made the storm a calm,  <paragraph-break/>So that the waves thereof were still. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>Then were they glad because they were quiet,  <paragraph-break/>And He led them unto their desired haven. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>Let them give thanks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for His mercy,  <paragraph-break/>And for His wonderful works to the children of men! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,  <paragraph-break/>And praise Him in the seat of the elders. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>He turneth rivers into a wilderness,  <paragraph-break/>And watersprings into a thirsty ground; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>A fruitful land into a salt waste,  <paragraph-break/>For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,  <paragraph-break/>And a dry land into watersprings. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>And there He maketh the hungry to dwell,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And they establish a city of habitation; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>And sow fields, and plant vineyards,  <paragraph-break/>Which yield fruits of increase. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>38</verse-number>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly,  <paragraph-break/>And suffereth not their cattle to decrease. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>Again, they are minished and dwindle away  <paragraph-break/>Through oppression of evil and sorrow. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>40</verse-number>He poureth contempt upon princes,  <paragraph-break/>And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>41</verse-number>Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction,  <paragraph-break/>And maketh his families like a flock. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>42</verse-number>The upright see it, and are glad;  <paragraph-break/>And all iniquity stoppeth her mouth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>43</verse-number>Whoso is wise, let him observe these things,  <paragraph-break/>And let them consider the mercies of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>108</chapter-number>A Song, a Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>My heart is steadfast, O God;  <paragraph-break/>I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Awake, psaltery and harp;  <paragraph-break/>I will awake the dawn. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>I will give thanks unto Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, among the peoples;  
         <paragraph-break/>And I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For Thy mercy is great above the heavens,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy truth reacheth unto the skies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;  <paragraph-break/>And Thy glory be above all the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>That Thy beloved may be delivered,  <paragraph-break/>Save with Thy right hand, and answer me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult;  <paragraph-break/>That I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine;  <paragraph-break/>Ephraim also is the defence of my head;  <paragraph-break/>Judah is my sceptre. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Moab is my washpot;  <paragraph-break/>Upon Edom do I cast my shoe;  <paragraph-break/>Over Philistia do I cry aloud. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Who will bring me into the fortified city?  <paragraph-break/>Who will lead me unto Edom? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Hast not Thou cast us off, O God?  <paragraph-break/>And Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Give us help against the adversary;  <paragraph-break/>For vain is the help of man. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Through God we shall do valiantly;  <paragraph-break/>For He it is that will tread down our adversaries. <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <chapter-number>109</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>O God of my praise, keep not silence; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me;  <paragraph-break/>They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>They compassed me about also with words of hatred,  <paragraph-break/>And fought against me without a cause. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>In return for my love they are my adversaries;  <paragraph-break/>But I am all prayer. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>And they have laid upon me evil for good,  <paragraph-break/>And hatred for my love: <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>‘Set Thou a wicked man over him;  <paragraph-break/>And let an adversary stand at his right hand. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>When he is judged, let him go forth condemned;  <paragraph-break/>And let his prayer be turned into sin. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Let his days be few;  <paragraph-break/>Let another take his charge. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Let his children be fatherless,  <paragraph-break/>And his wife a widow. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Let his children be vagabonds, and beg;  <paragraph-break/>And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Let the creditor distrain all that he hath;  <paragraph-break/>And let strangers make spoil of his labour. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Let there be none to extend kindness unto him;  <paragraph-break/>Neither let there be any to be gracious unto his fatherless children. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Let his posterity be cut off;  <paragraph-break/>In the generation following let their name be blotted out. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Let the iniquity of his fathers be brought to remembrance unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Let them be before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> continually,  <paragraph-break/>That He may cut off the memory of them from the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Because that he remembered not to do kindness,  <paragraph-break/>But persecuted the poor and needy man,  <paragraph-break/>And the broken in heart he was ready to slay. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him;  <paragraph-break/>And he delighted not in blessing, and it is far from him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>He clothed himself also with cursing as with his raiment,  <paragraph-break/>And it is come into his inward parts like water,  <paragraph-break/>And like oil into his bones. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Let it be unto him as the garment which he putteth on,  <paragraph-break/>And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>This would mine adversaries effect from the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And they that speak evil against my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>But Thou, O <small-caps>God</small-caps> the Lord, deal with me for Thy name's sake;  <paragraph-break/>Because Thy mercy is good, deliver Thou me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>For I am poor and needy,  <paragraph-break/>And my heart is wounded within me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>I am gone like the shadow when it lengtheneth;  <paragraph-break/>I am shaken off as the locust. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>My knees totter through fasting;  <paragraph-break/>And my flesh is lean, and hath no fatness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>I am become also a taunt unto them;  <paragraph-break/>When they see me, they shake their head. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>Help me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God;  <paragraph-break/>O save me according to Thy mercy; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>That they may know that this is Thy hand;  <paragraph-break/>That Thou, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hast done it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>Let them curse, but bless Thou;  <paragraph-break/>When they arise, they shall be put to shame, but Thy servant shall rejoice. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>Mine adversaries shall be clothed with confusion,  <paragraph-break/>And shall put on their own shame as a robe. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>I will give great thanks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> with my mouth;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, I will praise Him among the multitude; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>Because He standeth at the right hand of the needy,  
         <paragraph-break/>To save him from them that judge his soul. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>110</chapter-number>A Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> saith unto my lord: ‘Sit thou at My right hand,  <paragraph-break/>Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>The rod of Thy strength the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will send out of Zion:  <paragraph-break/>'Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.' <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath sworn, and will not repent:  <paragraph-break/>'Thou art a priest for ever  <paragraph-break/>After the manner of Melchizedek.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>The Lord at thy right hand  <paragraph-break/>Doth crush kings in the day of His wrath. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>He will judge among the nations;  <paragraph-break/>He filleth it with the dead bodies,  <paragraph-break/>He crusheth the head over a wide land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>He will drink of the brook in the way;  <paragraph-break/>Therefore will he lift up the head. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>14</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> increase you more and more,  <paragraph-break/>You and your children. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Blessed be ye of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>Who made heaven and earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>The heavens are the heavens of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>But the earth hath He given to the children of men. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>The dead praise not the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Neither any that go down into silence; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>But we will bless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>From this time forth and for ever.  <paragraph-break/>Hallelujah. <paragraph-break/> I love that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> should hear

         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Because He hath inclined His ear unto me,  <paragraph-break/>Therefore will I call upon Him all my days. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The cords of death compassed me,  <paragraph-break/>And the straits of the nether-world got hold upon me;  <paragraph-break/>I found trouble and sorrow. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>But I called upon the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>:  <paragraph-break/>'I beseech thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, deliver my soul.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Gracious is the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and righteous;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, our God is compassionate. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> preserveth the simple;  <paragraph-break/>I was brought low, and He saved me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Return, O my soul, unto Thy rest;  <paragraph-break/>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath dealt bountifully with thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>For thou hast delivered my soul from death,  <paragraph-break/>Mine eyes from tears,  <paragraph-break/>And my feet from stumbling. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>I shall walk before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>In the lands of the living. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>I trusted even when I spoke:  <paragraph-break/>'I am greatly afflicted.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>I said in my haste:  <paragraph-break/>'All men are liars.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>How can I repay unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>All His bountiful dealings toward me? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>I will lift up the cup of salvation,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And call upon the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>My vows will I pay unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, in the presence of all His people. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>Precious in the sight of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>Is the death of His saints. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>I beseech Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for I am Thy servant;  <paragraph-break/>I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast loosed my bands. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,  <paragraph-break/>And will call upon the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>I will pay my vows unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Yea, in the presence of all His people; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>In the courts of the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps> house,  <paragraph-break/>In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.  <paragraph-break/>Hallelujah. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>117</chapter-number>O praise the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all ye  nations;  <paragraph-break/>Laud Him, all ye peoples. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>For His mercy is great toward us;  <paragraph-break/>And the truth of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> endureth for ever.  <paragraph-break/>Hallelujah. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>118</chapter-number>'O give thanks unto the  <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for He is good,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>So let Israel now say,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>So let the house of Aaron now say,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>So let them now that fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> say,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Out of my straits I called upon the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>He answered me with great enlargement. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is for me; I will not fear;  <paragraph-break/>What can man do unto me? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is for me as my helper;  <paragraph-break/>And I shall gaze upon them that hate me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>It is better to take refuge in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>Than to trust in man. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>It is better to take refuge in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>Than to trust in princes. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>All nations compass me about;  <paragraph-break/>Verily, in the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> I will cut them off. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>They compass me about, yea, they compass me about;  <paragraph-break/>Verily, in the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> I will cut them off. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>They compass me about like bees;  <paragraph-break/>They are quenched as the fire of thorns;  <paragraph-break/>Verily, in the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> I will cut them off. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall;  <paragraph-break/>But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> helped me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is my strength and song;  <paragraph-break/>And He is become my salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>The right hand of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> doeth valiantly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>The right hand of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is exalted;  <paragraph-break/>The right hand of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> doeth valiantly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>I shall not die, but live,  <paragraph-break/>And declare the works of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath chastened me sore;  <paragraph-break/>But He hath not given me over unto death. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>Open to me the gates of righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>This is the gate of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>The righteous shall enter into it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>I will give thanks unto Thee, for Thou hast answered me,  <paragraph-break/>And art become my salvation. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>The stone which the builders rejected  <paragraph-break/>Is become the chief corner-stone. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>This is the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps> doing;  <paragraph-break/>It is marvellous in our eyes. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Our soul is full sated  <paragraph-break/>With the scorning of those that are at ease,  <paragraph-break/>And with the contempt of the proud oppressors. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>124</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents; of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>'If it had not been the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who was for us',  <paragraph-break/>Let Israel now say; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>'If it had not been the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who was for us,  <paragraph-break/>When men rose up against us, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Then they had swallowed us up alive,  <paragraph-break/>When their wrath was kindled against us; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Then the waters had overwhelmed us,  <paragraph-break/>The stream had gone over our soul; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Then the proud waters  <paragraph-break/>Had gone over our soul.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Blessed be the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Wo hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers;  <paragraph-break/>The snare is broken, and we are escaped. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Our help is in the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>Who made heaven and earth. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>125</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents.   <paragraph-break/>They that trust in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>As the mountains are round about Jerusalem,  <paragraph-break/>So the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is round about His people,  <paragraph-break/>From this time forth and for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous;  <paragraph-break/>That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Do good, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, unto the good,  <paragraph-break/>And to them that are upright in their hearts. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways,  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.  <paragraph-break/>Peace be upon Israel. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>126</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents.   <paragraph-break/>When the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> brought back those that returned to Zion,  <paragraph-break/>We were like unto them that dream. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Then was our mouth filled with laughter,  <paragraph-break/>And our tongue with singing;  <paragraph-break/>Then said they among the nations:  <paragraph-break/>'The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath done great things with these.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath done great things with us;  <paragraph-break/>We are rejoiced. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Turn our captivity, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>As the streams in the dry land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>They that sow in tears  <paragraph-break/>Shall reap in joy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Though he goeth on his way weeping that beareth the measure of seed,  <paragraph-break/>He shall come home with joy, bearing his sheaves. <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <chapter-number>127</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents; of Solomon.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>Except the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> build the house,  <paragraph-break/>They labour in vain that build it;  <paragraph-break/>Except the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> keep the city,  <paragraph-break/>The watchman waketh but in vain. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>It is vain for you that ye rise early, and sit up late,  <paragraph-break/>Ye that eat the bread of toil;  <paragraph-break/>So He giveth unto His beloved in sleep. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Lo, children are a heritage of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>The fruit of the womb is a reward. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,  <paragraph-break/>So are the children of one's youth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them;  <paragraph-break/>They shall not be put to shame,  <paragraph-break/>When they speak with their enemies in the gate. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>128</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents.   <paragraph-break/>Happy is every one that feareth the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>That walketh in His ways. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>When thou eatest the labour of thy hands,  <paragraph-break/>Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house;  <paragraph-break/>Thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Behold, surely thus shall the man be blessed  <paragraph-break/>That feareth the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> bless thee out of Zion;  <paragraph-break/>And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>And see thy children's children.  <paragraph-break/>Peace be upon Israel! <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>129</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents.   <paragraph-break/>'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up',  <paragraph-break/>Let Israel now say; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up;  <paragraph-break/>But they have not prevailed against me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The plowers plowed upon my back;  <paragraph-break/>They made long their furrows. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is righteous;  <paragraph-break/>He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Let them be ashamed and turned backward,  <paragraph-break/>All they that hate Zion. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,  <paragraph-break/>Which withereth afore it springeth up; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand,  <paragraph-break/>Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Neither do they that go by say:  <paragraph-break/>‘The blessing of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> be upon you;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>We bless you in the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>130</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents.   <paragraph-break/>Out of the depths have I called Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Lord, hearken unto my voice;  <paragraph-break/>Let Thine ears be attentive  <paragraph-break/>To the voice of my supplications. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>If Thou, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, shouldest mark iniquities,  <paragraph-break/>O Lord, who could stand? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For with Thee there is forgiveness,  <paragraph-break/>That Thou mayest be feared. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I wait for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, my soul doth wait,  <paragraph-break/>And in His word do I hope. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>My soul waiteth for the Lord,  <paragraph-break/>More than watchmen for the morning;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, more than watchmen for the morning. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>O Israel, hope in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>For with the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> there is mercy,  <paragraph-break/>And with Him is plenteous redemption. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And He will redeem Israel  <paragraph-break/>From all his iniquities. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty;  
         <paragraph-break/>Neither do I exercise myself in things too great, or in things too wonderful for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul;  <paragraph-break/>Like a weaned child with his mother;  <paragraph-break/>My soul is with me like a weaned child. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>O Israel, hope in the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>  
         <paragraph-break/>From this time forth and for ever. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>132</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents.   <paragraph-break/>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, remember unto David  <paragraph-break/>All his affliction; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>How he swore unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>‘Surely I will not come into the tent of my house,  <paragraph-break/>Nor go up into the bed that is spread for me; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>I will not give sleep to mine eyes,  <paragraph-break/>Nor slumber to mine eyelids; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Until I find out a place for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>A dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.' <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath;  <paragraph-break/>We found it in the field of <note mark="a" id="note-1051-a"> Heb. <other-text font="Times New Roman,Italic" size="10.046" y="36.399">Joar</other-text>.

         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Let us go into His dwelling-place;  <paragraph-break/>Let us worship at His footstool. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Arise, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, unto Thy resting-place;  <paragraph-break/>Thou, and the ark of Thy strength. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>And let Thy saints shout for joy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For Thy servant David's sake  <paragraph-break/>Turn not away the face of Thine anointed. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> swore unto David in truth;  <paragraph-break/>He will not turn back from it:  <paragraph-break/>'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>If thy children keep My covenant  <paragraph-break/>And My testimony that I shall teach them,  <paragraph-break/>Their children also for ever shall sit upon thy throne.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath chosen Zion;  <paragraph-break/>He hath desired it for His habitation: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>'This is My resting-place for ever;  <paragraph-break/>Here will I dwell; for I have desired it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>I will abundantly bless her provision;  <paragraph-break/>I will give her needy bread in plenty. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Her priests also will I clothe with salvation;  <paragraph-break/>And her saints shall shout aloud for joy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>There will I make a horn to shoot up unto David,  <paragraph-break/>There have I ordered a lamp for Mine anointed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>His enemies will I clothe with shame;  
         <paragraph-break/>But upon himself shall his crown shine.' <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>133</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents; of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is  <paragraph-break/>For brethren to dwell together in unity! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>It is like the precious oil upon the head,  <paragraph-break/>Coming down upon the beard;  <paragraph-break/>Even Aaron's beard,  <paragraph-break/>That cometh down upon the collar of his garments; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Like the dew of Hermon,  <paragraph-break/>That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion;  <paragraph-break/>For there the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded the blessing,  <paragraph-break/>Even life for ever. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>134</chapter-number>A Song of Ascents.   <paragraph-break/>Behold, bless ye the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, all ye servants of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>That stand in the house of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in the night seasons. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Lift up your hands to the sanctuary,  <paragraph-break/>And bless ye the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> bless thee out of Zion;  <paragraph-break/>Even He that made heaven and earth. <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>Give praise, O ye servants of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Ye that stand in the house of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>In the courts of the house of our God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Praise ye the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is good;  <paragraph-break/>Sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath chosen Jacob unto Himself,  <paragraph-break/>And Israel for His own treasure. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>For I know that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is great,  <paragraph-break/>And that our Lord is above all gods. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Whatsoever the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> pleased, that hath He done,  <paragraph-break/>In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>He maketh lightnings for the rain;  <paragraph-break/>He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Who smote the first-born of Egypt,  <paragraph-break/>Both of man and beast. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,  <paragraph-break/>Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Who smote many nations,  <paragraph-break/>And slew mighty kings: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Sihon king of the Amorites,  <paragraph-break/>And Og king of Bashan,  <paragraph-break/>And all the kingdoms of Canaan; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And gave their land for a heritage,  
         <paragraph-break/>A heritage unto Israel His people. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thy name endureth for ever;  <paragraph-break/>Thy memorial, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, throughout all generations. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will judge His people,  <paragraph-break/>And repent Himself for His servants. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>The idols of the nations are silver and gold,  <paragraph-break/>The work of men's hands. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>They have mouths, but they speak not;  <paragraph-break/>Eyes have they, but they see not; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>They have ears, but they hear not;  <paragraph-break/>Neither is there any breath in their mouths. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>They that make them shall be like unto them;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, every one that trusteth in them. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>9</verse-number>The moon and stars to rule by night,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>To Him that smote Egypt in their first-born,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And brought out Israel from among them,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>To Him who divided the Red Sea in sunder,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever; <paragraph-break/>

         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea,  <paragraph-break/>For His mercy endureth for ever. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Upon the willows in the midst thereof  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>We hanged up our harps. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For there they that led us captive asked of us words of song,  <paragraph-break/>And our tormentors asked of us mirth:  <paragraph-break/>‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>How shall we sing the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps> song  <paragraph-break/>In a foreign land? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,  <paragraph-break/>Let my right hand forget her cunning. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,  <paragraph-break/>If I remember thee not;  <paragraph-break/>If I set not Jerusalem  <paragraph-break/>Above my chiefest joy. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Remember, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, against the children of Edom  <paragraph-break/>The day of Jerusalem;  <paragraph-break/>Who said: 'Rase it, rase it,  <paragraph-break/>Even to the foundation thereof.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed;  <paragraph-break/>Happy shall he be, that repayeth thee  <paragraph-break/>As thou hast served us. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones  <paragraph-break/>Against the rock. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>138</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of David.   <paragraph-break/>I will give Thee thanks with my whole heart,  <paragraph-break/>In the presence of the mighty will I sing praises unto Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>I will bow down toward Thy holy temple,  
         <paragraph-break/>And give thanks unto Thy name for Thy mercy and for Thy truth;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>In the day that I called, Thou didst answer me;  <paragraph-break/>Thou didst encourage me in my soul with strength. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>All the kings of the earth shall give Thee thanks, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>For they have heard the words of Thy mouth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>For great is the glory of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>For though the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> be high, yet regardeth He the lowly,  <paragraph-break/>And the haughty He knoweth from afar. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou quickenest me;  <paragraph-break/>Thou stretchest forth Thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy right hand doth save me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will accomplish that which concerneth me;  <paragraph-break/>Thy mercy, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, endureth for ever;  <paragraph-break/>Forsake not the work of Thine own hands. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>139</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou hast searched me, and known me. 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,  <paragraph-break/>Thou understandest my thought afar off. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou measurest my going about and my lying down,  <paragraph-break/>And art acquainted with all my ways. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>For there is not a word in my tongue,  <paragraph-break/>But, lo, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thou knowest it altogether. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou hast hemmed me in behind and before,  <paragraph-break/>And laid Thy hand upon me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;  <paragraph-break/>Too high, I cannot attain unto it. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Whither shall I go from Thy spirit?  <paragraph-break/>Or whither shall I flee from Thy presence? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there;  <paragraph-break/>If I make my bed in the nether-world, behold, Thou art there. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>If I take the wings of the morning,  <paragraph-break/>And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Even there would Thy hand lead me,  <paragraph-break/>And Thy right hand would hold me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And if I say: ‘Surely the darkness shall envelop me,  <paragraph-break/>And the light about me shall be night'; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee,  <paragraph-break/>But the night shineth as the day;  
         <paragraph-break/>The darkness is even as the light. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>For Thou hast made my reins;  <paragraph-break/>Thou hast knit me together in my mother's womb. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>I will give thanks unto Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;  <paragraph-break/>Wonderful are Thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>My frame was not hidden from Thee,  <paragraph-break/>When I was made in secret,  <paragraph-break/>And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance,  <paragraph-break/>And in Thy book they were all written— <paragraph-break/>Even the days that were fashioned,  <paragraph-break/>When as yet there was none of them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>How weighty also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God!  <paragraph-break/>How great is the sum of them! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand;  <paragraph-break/>Were I to come to the end of them, I would still be with Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>If Thou but wouldest slay the wicked, O God— <paragraph-break/>Depart from me therefore, ye men of blood; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Who utter Thy name with wicked thought,  <paragraph-break/>They take it for falsehood, even Thine enemies— 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Do not I hate them, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, that hate Thee?  <paragraph-break/>And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>I hate them with utmost hatred;  <paragraph-break/>I count them mine enemies. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>Search me, O God, and know my heart,  <paragraph-break/>Try me, and know my thoughts; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And see if there be any way in me that is grievous,  <paragraph-break/>And lead me in the way everlasting. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>140</chapter-number>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Deliver me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, from the evil man;  <paragraph-break/>Preserve me from the violent man; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Who devise evil things in their heart;  <paragraph-break/>Every day do they stir up wars. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent;  <paragraph-break/>Vipers' venom is under their lips.  Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Keep me, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, from the hands of the wicked;  <paragraph-break/>Preserve me from the violent man;  <paragraph-break/>Who have purposed to make my steps slip. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;  <paragraph-break/>They have spread a net by the wayside;  <paragraph-break/>They have set gins for me.       Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>I have said unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>: 'Thou art my God';  <paragraph-break/>Give ear, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, unto the voice of my supplications. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>O <small-caps>God</small-caps> the Lord, the strength of my salvation,  <paragraph-break/>Who hast screened my head in the day of battle, <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Grant not, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the desires of the wicked;  <paragraph-break/>Further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves.          Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>As for the head of those that compass me about,  <paragraph-break/>Let the mischief of their own lips cover them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Let burning coals fall upon them;  <paragraph-break/>Let them be cast into the fire,  <paragraph-break/>Into deep pits, that they rise not up again. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>A slanderer shall not be established in the earth;  <paragraph-break/>The violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>I know that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will maintain the cause of the poor,  <paragraph-break/>And the right of the needy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name;  <paragraph-break/>The upright shall dwell in Thy presence. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>141</chapter-number>A Psalm of David.   <paragraph-break/>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, I have called Thee; make haste unto me;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto Thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee,  <paragraph-break/>The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Set a guard, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, to my mouth;  <paragraph-break/>Keep watch at the door of my lips. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Incline not my heart to any evil thing,  <paragraph-break/>To be occupied in deeds of wickedness  <paragraph-break/>With men that work iniquity;  <paragraph-break/>And let me not eat of their dainties. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Let the righteous smite me in kindness, and correct me;  <paragraph-break/>Oil so choice let not my head refuse;  <paragraph-break/>For still is my prayer because of their wickedness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock;  <paragraph-break/>And they shall hear my words, that they are sweet. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>As when one cleaveth and breaketh up the earth,  <paragraph-break/>Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>For mine eyes are unto Thee, O <small-caps>God</small-caps> the Lord;  <paragraph-break/>In Thee have I taken refuge, O pour not out my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,  <paragraph-break/>And from the gins of the workers of iniquity. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Let the wicked fall into their own nets,  
         <paragraph-break/>Whilst I withal escape. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>142</chapter-number>Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>With my voice I cry unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>With my voice I make supplication unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>I pour out my complaint before Him,  <paragraph-break/>I declare before Him my trouble; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>When my spirit fainteth within me— <paragraph-break/>Thou knowest my path— <paragraph-break/>In the way wherein I walk  <paragraph-break/>Have they hidden a snare for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>Look on my right hand, and see,  <paragraph-break/>For there is no man that knoweth me;  <paragraph-break/>I have no way to flee;  <paragraph-break/>No man careth for my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>I have cried unto Thee, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>I have said: 'Thou art my refuge,  <paragraph-break/>My portion in the land of the living.' <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Attend unto my cry;  <paragraph-break/>For I am brought very low;  <paragraph-break/>Deliver me from my persecutors;  <paragraph-break/>For they are too strong for me. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Bring my soul out of prison,  <paragraph-break/>That I may give thanks unto Thy name;  <paragraph-break/>The righteous shall crown themselves because of me;  <paragraph-break/>For Thou wilt deal bountifully with me. <paragraph-break/> A Psalm of David.   
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications;  <paragraph-break/>In Thy faithfulness answer me, and in Thy righteousness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>And enter not into judgment with Thy servant;  <paragraph-break/>For in Thy sight shall no man living be justified. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;  <paragraph-break/>He hath crushed my life down to the ground;  <paragraph-break/>He hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>And my spirit fainteth within me;  <paragraph-break/>My heart within me is appalled. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>I remember the days of old;  <paragraph-break/>I meditate on all Thy doing;  <paragraph-break/>I muse on the work of Thy hands. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>I spread forth my hands unto Thee;  <paragraph-break/>My soul [thirsteth] after Thee, as a weary land.                           Selah <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Answer me speedily, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>My spirit faileth;  <paragraph-break/>Hide not Thy face from me;  <paragraph-break/>Lest I become like them that go down into the pit. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning,  <paragraph-break/>For in Thee do I trust;  <paragraph-break/>Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk,  <paragraph-break/>For unto Thee have I lifted up my soul. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Deliver me from mine enemies, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>;  <paragraph-break/>With Thee have I hidden myself. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Teach me to do Thy will,  <paragraph-break/>For Thou art my God;  <paragraph-break/>Let Thy good spirit  <paragraph-break/>Lead me in an even land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>For Thy name's sake, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, quicken me;  <paragraph-break/>In Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And in Thy mercy cut off mine enemies,  <paragraph-break/>And destroy all them that harass my soul;  <paragraph-break/>For I am Thy servant. <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>144</chapter-number>[A Psalm] of David.   <paragraph-break/>Blessed be the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my Rock,  <paragraph-break/>Who traineth my hands for war,  <paragraph-break/>And my fingers for battle; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>My lovingkindness, and my fortress,  <paragraph-break/>My high tower, and my deliverer;  <paragraph-break/>My shield, and He in whom I take refuge;  <paragraph-break/>Who subdueth my people under me. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, what is man, that Thou takest knowledge of him?  <paragraph-break/>Or the son of man, that Thou makest account of him? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Man is like unto a breath;  <paragraph-break/>His days are as a shadow that passeth away. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, bow Thy heavens, and come down;  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>Touch the mountains, that they may smoke. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;  <paragraph-break/>Send out Thine arrows, and discomfit them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Stretch forth Thy hands from on high;  <paragraph-break/>Rescue me, and deliver me out of many waters,  <paragraph-break/>Out of the hand of strangers; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Whose mouth speaketh falsehood,  <paragraph-break/>And their right hand is a right hand of lying. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>O God, I will sing a new song unto Thee,  <paragraph-break/>Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto Thee; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Who givest salvation unto kings,  <paragraph-break/>Who rescuest David Thy servant from the hurtful sword. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers,  <paragraph-break/>Whose mouth speaketh falsehood,  <paragraph-break/>And their right hand is a right hand of lying. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth;  <paragraph-break/>Whose daughters are as corner-pillars carved after the fashion of a palace; <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>Whose garners are full, affording all manner of store;  <paragraph-break/>Whose sheep increase by thousands and ten thousands in our fields; <paragraph-break/>
