         <h3>
            		  Chapter 1
         </h3>AND IT came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: ‘Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother: ‘Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise
         will go with thee into thy lot.’ So Simeon went with him. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Judah went up; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <span class="verse-number">6</span>But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Adoni-bezek said: ‘Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered food under my
         table; as I have done, so God hath requited me.’ And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the children of Judah fought Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight 
         against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the Lowland. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron—now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba—and they smote
         Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir—now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Caleb said: ‘He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field; and she alighted from off her
         ass; and Caleb said unto her: ‘What wouldest thou?’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And she said unto him: ‘Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the Southland, give me therefore springs of water.’
         And Caleb gave her the Upper Springs and the Nether Springs.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the children of the Kenite, Moses’father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into
         the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
         because they had chariots of iron. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken; and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children
         of Benjamin in Jerusalem, unto this day.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with them. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el—now the name of the city beforetime was Luz. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him: ‘Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
         city, and we will deal kindly with thee.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And he showed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go
         and all his family. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof
         unto this day.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its 
         towns, nor of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns,
         nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites were resolved to dwell in that land. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And it came to pass, when Israel was waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to task-work, but did in no wise drive them
         out.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">30</span>Zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the: inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and
         became tributary.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">31</span>Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor
         of Aphik, nor of Rehob; <span class="verse-number">32</span>but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">33</span>Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites,
         the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributary unto them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">34</span>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley.
         <span class="verse-number">35</span>But the Amorites were resolved to dwell in Harheres, in 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributary. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward.  
         <h3>
            		  Chapter 2
         </h3>And the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said: ‘. . . I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which
         I swore unto your fathers; and I said: I will never break My covenant with you; <span class="verse-number">2</span>and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars; but ye have not hearkened
         unto My voice; what is this ye have done? <span class="verse-number">3</span>Wherefore I also said: I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be unto you as snares, and their gods shall
         be a trap unto you.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass, when the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And they called the name of that place

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the people served the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that He had wrought for Israel. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Joshua the 
         son of Nun, the servant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, died, being a hundred and ten years old. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the
         mountain of Gaash. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, that knew not
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, nor yet the work which He had wrought for Israel.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and served the Baalim. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And they forsook the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples
         that were round about them, and worshipped them; and they provoked the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And they forsook the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and He gave them over into
         the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. <span class="verse-number">15</span>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was against them for evil, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken, and as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had sworn unto them; and they were sore distressed. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And yet they hearkened not unto their judges, for they went astray after other gods, and 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         worshipped them; they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; they did not so. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised them up judges, then the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them. <span class="verse-number">19</span>But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following
         other gods to serve them, and to worship them; they left nothing undone of their practices, nor of their stubborn way. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel; and He said: ‘Because this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers,
         and have not hearkened unto My voice; <span class="verse-number">21</span>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died; <span class="verse-number">22</span>that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>So the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered He them into the hand of Joshua.  
         <h3>
            		  Chapter 3
         </h3>Now these are the nations which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan; <span class="verse-number">2</span>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the 
         least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof; <span class="verse-number">3</span>namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
         Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And they were there, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
         and the Jebusites; <span class="verse-number">6</span>and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and forgot the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Therefore the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and He gave them over into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim; and the children
         of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the spirit of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into his hand; and his hand prevailed

         against Cushan-rishathaim. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. <span class="verse-number">15</span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed; and the children of Israel sent a present
         by him unto Eglon the king of Moab. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he offered the present unto Eglon king of Moab—now Eglon was a very fat man. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And when he had made an end of offering the present, he sent away the people that bore the present. <span class="verse-number">19</span>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said: ‘I have a secret errand unto thee, O king.’ And
         he said: ‘Keep silence.’ And all that stood by him went out from him. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in his cool upper chamber. And Ehud said: ‘I have a message from
         God unto thee.’ And he arose out of his seat. 
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his belly;
         and it came out behind. <span class="verse-number">23</span>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and locked them. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they,
         said: ‘Surely he is covering his feet in the cabinet of the cool chamber.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; therefore they took the
         key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Ehud escaped while they lingered, having passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a horn in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
         down with him from the hill-country, and he before them. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And he said unto them: ‘Follow after me; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.’ And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan
         against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valour; and there escaped not
         a man. 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">30</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">31</span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also saved
         Israel.  
         <h3>
            		  Chapter 4
         </h3>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when Ehud was dead. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave them over into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt
         in Harosheth-goiim. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the children of Israel cried unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.

         came up to her for judgment. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him: ‘Hath not the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, commanded, saying: Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children
         of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? <span class="verse-number">7</span>And I will draw unto thee to the brook Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and
         I will deliver him into thy hand. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Barak said unto her: ‘If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; 
         but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And she said: ‘I will surely go with thee; notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honour; for the

         into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And he said unto her: ‘Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.’ And she opened a bottle of milk,
         and gave him drink, and covered him. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And he said unto her: ‘Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say:
         Is there any man here? that thou shalt say: No.’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his
         temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him: ‘Come, and I will show thee the man whom
         thou seekest.’ And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples. <span class="verse-number">23</span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed

         <span class="verse-number">25</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto him: ‘Take thy father’s bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that
         thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it; <span class="verse-number">26</span>and build an altar unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with
         the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken unto him; and it came to pass, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so that he could
         not do it by day, that he did it by night. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut
         down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And they said one to another: ‘Who hath done this thing?’ And when they inquired and asked, they said: ‘Gideon the son of

         said unto Joash: ‘Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut

         pray Thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.’
         <span class="verse-number">40</span>And God did so that night; for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.  
         <h3>
            		  Chapter 7
         </h3>Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside En-harod; and the
         camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Gideon: ‘The people that are with thee are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel
         vaunt themselves against Me, saying: mine own hand hath saved me. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Now therefore make proclamation in the ears of the people, saying: Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and
         depart early from mount Gilead.’ And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Gideon: ‘The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it
         shall be, that of whom I say to thee: This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto 
         thee: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>So he brought down the people unto the water; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Gideon: ‘Everyone that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise
         every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people
         bowed down upon their knees to drink water. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Gideon: ‘By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let
         all the people go every man unto his place.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>So they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their horns; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his
         tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto him: ‘Arise, get thee down upon the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand. <span class="verse-number">10</span>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down upon the camp.’ Then went he down
         with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his follow, and saying: ‘Behold, I dreamed a dream,
         and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned
         it upside down, that the tent lay flat.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And his fellow answered and said: ‘This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his
         hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned
         into the camp of Israel, and said: ‘Arise; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them horns, and empty pitchers,
         with torches within the pitchers. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said unto them: ‘Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall
         be that, as I do, so shall ye do. <span class="verse-number">18</span>When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the horns also on every side of all the camp, and say: For
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and for Gideon! ’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the 
         beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the horns, and broke in pieces the pitchers
         that were in their hands. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And the three companies blew the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the horns in
         their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried: ‘The sword for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and for Gideon! ’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and fled. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And they blew the three hundred horns, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> set every man’s sword a against his fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward
         Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after
         Midian. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying: ‘Come down against Midian, and take before
         them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.’ So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the
         waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the
         Winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.

            		  Chapter 8
         </h3>And the men of Ephraim said unto him: ‘Why hast thou served us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight
         with Midian?’ And they did chide with him sharply. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he said unto them: ‘What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage
         of Abiezer? <span class="verse-number">3</span>God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?’
         Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he said unto the men of Succoth: ‘Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint,
         and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the princes of Succoth said: ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thine
         army?’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Gideon said: ‘Therefore when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.’
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth
         had answered. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying: ‘When I 
         come back in peace, I will break down this tower.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the
         host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host
         was secure. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited
         all the host. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and
         the elders thereof, seventy and seven men. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: ‘Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the
         hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: ‘Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?’ And they answered: ‘As thou art, so were
         they; of one form 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         with the children of a king.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>And he said: ‘They were my brethren, the sons of my mother; as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And he said unto Jether his first-born: ‘Up, and slay them.’ But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was
         yet a youth. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: ‘Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.’ And Gideon arose, and
         slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’necks.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: ‘Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also; for thou hast
         saved us out of the hand of Midian.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And Gideon said unto them: ‘I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall rule over you.’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>And Gideon said unto them: ‘I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.’—For
         they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And they answered: ‘We will willingly give them.’ And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings
         of his spoil. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents,
         and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels’necks.
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah; 
         and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. <span class="verse-number">28</span>So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years
         in the days of Gideon.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">33</span>And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again went astray after the Baalim, and made

            		  Chapter 9
         </h3>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and spoke with them, and with all the family
         of the house of his mother’s father, saying: <span class="verse-number">2</span>‘Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem: Which is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are
         threescore and ten persons,

         rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And his mother’s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words; and their hearts inclined to
         follow Abimelech; for they said: ‘He is our brother.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
         light fellows, who followed him. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons,
         upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all Beth-millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the terebinth
         of the pillar that was in Shechem. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said
         unto them: ‘Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. <span class="verse-number">8</span>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree: Reign thou over us. <span class="verse-number">9</span>But the olive-tree said unto them: Should I leave my fatness, seeing that by me they honour God and man, and go to hold sway
         over the trees? <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the trees said to the fig-tree: Come thou, and reign over us. <span class="verse-number">11</span>But the fig-tree said unto them: Should I leave my sweetness, and my

         <span class="verse-number">53</span>And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull. <span class="verse-number">54</span>Then he called hastily unto the young man his armour-bearer, and said unto him: ‘Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say
         not of me: A woman slew him.’ And his young man thrust him through, and he died. <span class="verse-number">55</span>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. <span class="verse-number">56</span>Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren; <span class="verse-number">57</span>and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did

         </h3>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore
         not. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared unto the woman, and said unto her: ‘Behold now, thou art barren, and hast not borne; but thou shalt conceive, and
         bear a son. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. <span class="verse-number">5</span>For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto
         God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying: ‘A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the 
         countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name; <span class="verse-number">7</span>but he said unto me: Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any
         unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.’

         <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then Manoah entreated the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘Oh, <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I pray Thee, let the man of God whom Thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that
         shall be born.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah

         must offer it unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: ‘What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour?’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto him: ‘Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is hidden?’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on. <span class="verse-number">20</span>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. <span class="verse-number">21</span>But the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And Manoah said unto his wife: ‘We shall surely die, because we have seen God.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>But his wife said unto him: ‘If the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> were pleased to kill us, He would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would He have
         shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.’

         </h3>And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said: ‘I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines;
         now therefore get her for me to wife.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then his father and his mother said unto him: ‘Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
         people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?’ And Samson said unto his father: ‘Get her for me;
         for she pleaseth me well.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.

         <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and, behold, a young

         father or his mother what he had done. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And after a while he returned to

         take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion,
         and honey. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he scraped it out into his hands, and went on, eating as he went, and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto
         them, and they did eat; but he told them not that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Samson said unto them: ‘Let me now put forth a riddle unto you; if ye can declare it me within the seven days of the feast,
         and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment; <span class="verse-number">13</span>but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment.’ And they said
         unto him: ‘Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he said unto them:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Out of the eater came forth food,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And out of the strong came forth sweetness.

         the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire; have ye called us hither to impoverish us?’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said: ‘Thou dost but hate me, and 
         lovest me not; thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and wilt thou not tell it me?’ And he said unto
         her: ‘Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her,
         because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>What is sweeter than honey?  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And what is stronger than a lion?  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And he said unto them:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>If ye had not plowed with my heifer,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Ye had not found out my riddle.

         <span class="verse-number">19</span>And the spirit of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes
         of raiment unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house. <span class="verse-number">20</span>But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had had for his friend.

         </h3>But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said: ‘I
         will go in to my wife into the chamber.’ But her father would not suffer him to go in. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And her father said: ‘I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion; is not her
         younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of

         her.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Samson said unto them: ‘This time shall I be quits with the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between
         every two tails. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And when he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks
         and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then the Philistines said: ‘Who hath done this?’ And they said: ‘Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken
         his wife, and given her to his companion.’ And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Samson said unto them: ‘If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves against Lehi. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the men of Judah said: ‘Why are ye come up against us?’ And they said: ‘To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
         he hath done to us.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson: ‘Knowest thou not that the
         Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us?’ And he said unto them: ‘As they did unto me,
         so have I done 
         unto them.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And they said unto him: ‘We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.’ And Samson
         said unto them: ‘Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>And they spoke unto him, saying: ‘No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but surely we will not
         kill thee.’ And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock. <span class="verse-number">14</span>When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him; and the spirit of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped
         from off his hands. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And Samson said:

         and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is
         before Hebron.

         <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her: ‘Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth,
         and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven
         hundred pieces of silver.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Delilah said to Samson: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith 
         thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Samson said unto her: ‘If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and
         be as any other man.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried, and she bound him with
         them. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Now she had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him: ‘The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.’ And
         he broke the bowstrings as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Delilah said unto Samson: ‘Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest
         be bound.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And he said unto her: ‘If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work, hath been done, then shall I become weak, and
         be as any other man.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him: ‘The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.’ And the liers-in-wait

         and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he told her all his heart, and said unto her: ‘There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto
         God from my mother’s womb; if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other
         man.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying: ‘Come
         up this once, for he hath told me all his heart.’ Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money
         in their hand. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and had the seven locks of his head shaven off; and she began
         to afflict him, and his strength went from him. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And she said: ‘The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.’ And he awoke out of his sleep, and said: ‘I will go out as at other
         times, and shake myself.’ But he knew not that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was departed from him. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters
         of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Howbeit the hair of his

         <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for

         destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said: ‘Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.’ And they
         called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them; and they set him between the pillars. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand: ‘Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth,
         that I may lean upon them.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
         three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And Samson called unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘O Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only this once, O God, that I may be this once avenged of the
         Philistines for my two eyes.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>And Samson took fast hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right
         hand, and the other with his left. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And Samson said: ‘Let me

         die with the Philistines.’ And he bent with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that
         were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life. <span class="verse-number">31</span>Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
         and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

         </h3>Now there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he said unto his mother: ‘The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter
         a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.’ And his mother said: ‘Blessed be
         my son of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said: ‘I verily dedicate the silver unto
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder,
         who made thereof a graven image and a molten image; and it was in the house of Micah. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the man Micah had a house of God, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
         priest. <span class="verse-number">6</span>In those days there was no king in Israel; 
         every man did that which was right in his own eyes. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem in Judah—in the family of Judah—who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem in Judah, to sojourn where he could find a place; and he came to the
         hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And Micah said unto him: ‘Whence comest thou?’ And he said unto him: ‘I am a Levite of Beth-lehem in Judah, and I go to sojourn
         where I may find a place.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Micah said unto him: ‘Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by
         the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.’ So the Levite went in. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then said Micah: ‘Now know I that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest.’

         </h3>In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
         in; for unto that day there had nothing been allotted unto them among the tribes of Israel for an inheritance. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol,
         to spy out the land, and to

         search it; and they said unto them: ‘Go, search the land’; and they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of
         Micah, and lodged there. <span class="verse-number">3</span>When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and
         said unto him: ‘Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And he said unto them: ‘Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And they said unto him: ‘Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we are going shall be prosperous.’
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the priest said unto them: ‘Go in peace; before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is your way wherein ye go.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the
         manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame
         in any thing, and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no dealings with any man. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brethren said unto them: ‘What say ye?’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And they said: ‘Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good; and are ye
         still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land. <span class="verse-number">10</span>When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is

         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons

         it is behind Kiriath-jearim. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren: ‘Do ye know that there
         is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to
         do.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked
         him of his welfare. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
         the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons
         of war. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And when these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the graven image of the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image,
         the priest said unto them:

         ‘What do ye?’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>And they said unto him: ‘Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest;
         is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the
         people. <span class="verse-number">21</span>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them. <span class="verse-number">22</span>When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together,
         and overtook the children of Dan. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah: ‘What aileth thee, that thou comest
         with such a company?’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>And he said: ‘Ye have taken away my god which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then
         say ye unto me: What aileth thee?’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And the children of Dan said unto him: ‘Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose
         thy life, with the lives of thy household.’ <span class="verse-number">26</span>And the children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto
         his house. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure,

         a couple of asses; and she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to
         meet him. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days; so they did eat and drink, and
         lodged there. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel’s father
         said unto his son-in-law: ‘Stay thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together; and the damsel’s father said unto the man: ‘Be content, I
         pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel’s father said: ‘Stay thy heart, I pray thee,
         and tarry ye until the day declineth’; and they did eat, both of them. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, said unto
         him: ‘Behold, now the day draweth toward evening; tarry, I pray you, all night; behold, the day groweth to an end; lodge here,
         that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus—the same is Jerusalem; and
         there were with 
         him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him. <span class="verse-number">11</span>When they were by Jebus—the day was far spent—the servant said unto his master: ‘Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside
         into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And his master said unto him: ‘We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel;
         but we will pass over to Gibeah.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>And he said unto his servant: ‘Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.’
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah; and he went in, and sat him down in the broad place of the city;
         for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim,

         thou? and whence comest thou?’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said unto him: ‘We are passing from Beth-lehem in Judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from
         thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem in Judah, and I am now going to the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and there is no man that taketh

         the young man that is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And the old man said: ‘Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the broad place.’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. <span class="verse-number">22</span>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating
         at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying: ‘Bring forth the man that came into thy house,
         that we may know him.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them: ‘Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly;
         seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this wanton deed. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what
         seemeth good unto you; but unto this man do not so wanton a thing.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>But the men would not hearken to him; so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew
         her, and abused her all the night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let her go. <span class="verse-number">26</span>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s 
         house where her lord was, till it was light. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman
         his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And he said unto her.’ Up, and let us be going’; but none answered; then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up,
         and got him unto his place. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into
         twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And it was so, that all that saw it said: ‘Such a thing hath not happened nor been seen from the day that the children of

         battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the children of Israel went up and wept before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> until even; and they asked of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: ‘Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?’ And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘Go up against him.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel
         again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. <span class="verse-number">26</span>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the children of Israel asked of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>—for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, <span class="verse-number">28</span>and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days—saying: ‘Shall I yet again go out to battle
         against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?’ And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him into thy hand.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">30</span>And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against
         Gibeah, as at other times. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And the children of Benjamin went 
         out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times,
         in the field, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, about thirty men of Israel. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And the children of Benjamin said: ‘They are smitten down before us, as at the first.’ But the children of Israel said: ‘Let
         us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.’ <span class="verse-number">33</span>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar; and the liers-in-wait of
         Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that
         evil was close upon them. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred
         men; all these drew the sword.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">36</span>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten. And the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted
         unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.—<span class="verse-number">37</span>And the liers-in-wait hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew forth, and smote all the city with the
         edge of the sword. <span class="verse-number">38</span>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait, that they should make a great beacon of smoke
         rise up out of the city.—<span class="verse-number">39</span>And the men of Israel turned in the 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said: ‘Surely they are smitten
         down before us, as in the first battle.’ <span class="verse-number">40</span>But when the beacon began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold,
         the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. <span class="verse-number">41</span>And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were amazed; for they saw that evil was come upon them. <span class="verse-number">42</span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after
         them; and they that came out of the city destroyed them in the midst of the men of Israel. <span class="verse-number">43</span>They inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and overtook them at their resting-place, as far as over against
         Gibeah toward the sunrising. <span class="verse-number">44</span>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour. <span class="verse-number">45</span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand
         men; and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men. <span class="verse-number">46</span>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
         <span class="verse-number">47</span>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
         <span class="verse-number">48</span>And the men of Israel turned back upon the children 
         of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found; moreover
         all the cities which they found they set on fire.  
         <h3>
            		  Chapter 21
         </h3>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying: ‘There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And they said: ‘O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the children of Israel said: ‘Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>?’ For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Mizpah, saying: ‘He shall surely be put to death.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said: ‘There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
         day. <span class="verse-number">7</span>How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And they said: ‘What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Mizpah?’ And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. <span class="verse-number">9</span>For when the people were numbered, 
         
         
         
         <h2>JUDGES</h2>
         
         
         behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying: ‘Go and smite the inhabitants
         of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And this is the thing that ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him;
         and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace
         unto them. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead;
         and yet so they sufficed them not. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then the elders of the congregation said: ‘How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed
         out of Benjamin?’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And they said: ‘They that are escaped must be as an inheritance for Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>Howbeit we may not give them 
         wives of our daughters.’ For the children of Israel had sworn, saying: ‘Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>And they said: ‘Behold, there is the feast of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el
         to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying: ‘Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; <span class="verse-number">21</span>and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
         you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to strive with us, that we will say unto them: Grant them graciously
         unto us; because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle; neither did ye give them unto them, that ye should now
         be guilty.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried
         off; and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
         thence every man to his inheritance. <span class="verse-number">25</span>In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
