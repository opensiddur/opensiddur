         <h3>
            						Chapter 2
         </h3>I said in my heart: ‘Come now, I will try thee with mirth, and enjoy pleasure’; and, behold, this also was vanity. <span class="verse-number">2</span>I said of laughter: ‘It is mad’; and of mirth: ‘What doth it accomplish?’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>I searched in my heart how to pamper my flesh with wine, and, my heart conducting itself with wisdom, how yet to lay hold
         on folly, till I might see which it was best for the sons of men that they should do under the heaven the few days of their
         life. <span class="verse-number">4</span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; <span class="verse-number">5</span>I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; <span class="verse-number">6</span>I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the wood springing up with trees; <span class="verse-number">7</span>I acquired men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks,
         above all that were before me in Jerusalem; <span class="verse-number">8</span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and treasure such as kings and the provinces have as their own; I got me men-singers and
         women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, women very many. <span class="verse-number">9</span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom stood me in stead. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And 
         whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart had joy of all my labour;
         and this was my portion from all my labour. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was
         vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
         which hath been already done. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>The wise man, his eyes are in his head;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>But the fool walketh in darkness.  And I also perceived that one event happeneth to them all. <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then said I in my heart: ‘As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?’ Then I
         said in my heart, that this also is vanity. <span class="verse-number">16</span>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will long
         ago have been forgotten. And how must the wise man die even as the fool! <span class="verse-number">17</span>So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after
         wind.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>And I hated all my labour wherein I laboured under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>And who knoweth whether 
         
         
         
         
         he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shown
         myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. <span class="verse-number">20</span>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun. <span class="verse-number">21</span>For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein
         shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. <span class="verse-number">22</span>For what hath a man of all his labour, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboureth under the sun? <span class="verse-number">23</span>For all his days are pains, and his occupation vexation; yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. This also is vanity.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy pleasure for his labour. This
         also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. <span class="verse-number">25</span>For who will eat, or who will enjoy, if not I? <span class="verse-number">26</span>For to the man that is good in His sight He giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He giveth the task, to
         gather and to heap up, that he may leave to him that is good in the sight of God. This also is vanity and a striving after
         wind.

         </h3>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>A time to keep, and a time to cast away;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>A time to rend, and a time to sew;

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>A time to love, and a time to hate;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>A time for war, and a time for peace.  <span class="verse-number">9</span>What profit hath he that worketh in that he laboureth? <span class="verse-number">10</span>I have seen the task which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. <span class="verse-number">11</span>He hath made every thing beautiful in its time; also He hath set the world in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out
         the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. <span class="verse-number">12</span>I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to get pleasure so long as they live. <span class="verse-number">13</span>But also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy pleasure for all his labour, is the gift of God. <span class="verse-number">14</span>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it, 
         
         
         
         
         nor any thing taken from it; and God hath so made it, that men should fear before Him. <span class="verse-number">15</span>That which is hath been long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God seeketh that which is pursued.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that
         wickedness was there. <span class="verse-number">17</span>I said in my heart: ‘The righteous and the wicked God will judge; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
         work.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>I said in my heart: ‘It is because of the sons of men, that God may sift them, and that they may see that they themselves
         are but as beasts.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other;
         yea, they have all one breath; so that man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity. <span class="verse-number">20</span>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>Wherefore I perceived that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion;
         for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?  
         <h3>
            						Chapter 4
         </h3>But I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun; and behold the tears of such as were oppressed,
         and they had 
         no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive; <span class="verse-number">3</span>but better than they both is he that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man’s rivalry with his neighbour. This also is vanity
         and a striving after wind.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>The fool foldeth his hands together,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And eateth his own flesh.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>Better is a handful of quietness,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Than both the hands full of labour and striving after wind.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. <span class="verse-number">8</span>There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his
         labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches: ‘for whom then do I labour, and bereave my soul of pleasure?’ This also
         is vanity, yea, it is a grievous business. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. <span class="verse-number">10</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift
         him up. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone? <span class="verse-number">12</span>And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who 
         
         
         
         
         knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. <span class="verse-number">14</span>For out of prison he came forth to be king; although in his kingdom he was born poor. <span class="verse-number">15</span>I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the child, the second, that was to stand up in his stead.
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>There was no end of all the people, even of all them whom he did lead; yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him.
         Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>Guard thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be ready to hearken: it is better than when fools give sacrifices;
         for they know not that they do evil.   
         <h3>
            						Chapter 5
         </h3>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon
         earth; therefore let thy words be few.   
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>For a dream cometh through a multitude of business;

         should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?  <span class="verse-number">6</span>For through the multitude of 
         dreams and vanities there are also many words; but fear thou God.   
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent perverting of justice and righteousness in the state, marvel not

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment.  <span class="verse-number">6</span>For to every matter there is a time and judgment; for the evil of man is great upon him. <span class="verse-number">7</span>For he knoweth not that which shall be; for even when it cometh to pass, who shall declare it unto him? <span class="verse-number">8</span>There is no man that hath power over the wind to retain the wind; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is
         no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it. <span class="verse-number">9</span>All this have I seen, even applied my heart 
         thereto, whatever the work that is done under the sun; what time one man had power over another to his hurt.  <span class="verse-number">10</span>And so I saw the wicked buried, and they entered into their rest; but they that had done right went away from the holy place,

         fear God, that fear before Him; <span class="verse-number">13</span>but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he feareth not

         is vanity. <span class="verse-number">15</span>So I commended mirth, that a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry, and that
         this should accompany him in his labour all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.  <span class="verse-number">16</span>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth—for neither day nor night do men
         see sleep with their eyes—<span class="verse-number">17</span>then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the 
         
         
         
         
         work that is done under the sun; because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further, though

         unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner, and he that sweareth,
         as he that feareth an oath. <span class="verse-number">3</span>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all; yea also, the heart of the sons of men
