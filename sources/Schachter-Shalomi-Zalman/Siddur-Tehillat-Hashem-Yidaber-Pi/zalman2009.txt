{he בס"ד}

Dear Davvener,

If you are not used to reading Hebrew with comprehension and with the ability to dilate the Hebrew from the literal meaning, or if you cannot read Hebrew and need a resource for daily davvenen, I offer you this set of texts, which I, too, use frequently for myself.

I translated the Psalms and the liturgy in the way in which I experience them in my {emph feeling consciousness.} This does not offer the {translit he-Latn "'pshat,'"} the literal meaning of the words, but the devotional interpretation that can make it a prayer of the heart.

I suggest that you davven it first all the way through, reading it out loud enough to hear it yourself with feeling. You will like some sections better than others.

However, as you will note, there are 5 sections to this heart siddur.  They describe the raising your awareness from the realm of {emph sensation,} the prayer of {emph {translit he-Latn "Assiyah,"}} to the realm of {emph feelings,} the prayer of {emph {translit he-Latn "Yetzirah,"}} from there to the realm of {emph reason and the intellect,} the world of {emph {translit he-Latn "B’riyah"}} and to the summit, the world of the {emph intuition, {translit he-Latn "Atzilut."}}

When you are done with this ascent, coming back to the grounded world of sensation and action, you will need to reflect on the stirrings you felt on the way up and ask yourself these questions:
* How am I to apply this in my consensus reality and with my family and other contacts?
* How am I to act in a manner that will lead to the healing of our planet and society?

This part is called the {emph bringing down of the Divine influx, {translit he-Latn "yeridat hashefa’."}}

You may need to pick some paragraphs from each plane of prayer if all of it is too much for you. Some days you may wish to vary some parts and say others. This 'siddur' is meant to help you stay in daily touch with {dn God,} to gain blessed assistance from {dn God,} to lighten your burdens, not to add to them. Then recite some of the sentences of blessings and proceed with your daily tasks.

{poetry} 
May you experience
your praying
as a blessed meeting
with {dn your God.} 
{prose}

I worship You,

You formed me,
A human being,
So wisely.
You created in me
All kinds of
Hollows and ducts, 
Inner organs and intestines.

As I am all transparent to You,
It is apparent and clear,
That if any of these
That need to be open would clog,
Or any of these
Which need to be enclosed
Would seep,
I could not exist and live
In Your sight,
Not even for a moment.

So I am grateful 
And bless You,
For healing me,
In amazing ways.

At some time,
You will take it away from me,
And I will have breathed 
my last breath in this body.

And You will resuscitate me,
To the life of the spirit.

For each breath still in me,
I thank You,
My own {dn God,}
Who is also my parents' {dn God,}
{dn Lord} of all spirits,
Master of all that happens.

I offer You thanks,

And worship You,
For keeping me breathing.

And in this way,
With each breath,
You give me Life anew.

whether they scheme to do it 
or were unaware
whether it was in word or action
whether is was and thought

Whether it was in this incarnation 
or in any other
I completely forgive any God-wrestler;
let no one be punished on my account.

My {dn God} and my parents' {dn God} 
may our prayer come before You
do not turn Your attention 
from our pleading
we don't want to be impudent
we don't want to be stubborn

that in Your great mercy 
You erase my sins

be acceptable for You {dn Yah} my rock and my Redeemer
I place my faith in You
I place my trust in You

Against righteous souls, 
And shed pure blood in meanness,

{poetry}
/93:1 {dn Yah,} You ruled, robed in dignity.
Donning intensity, 
Girded with strength, 
Even the cosmos you arrayed 
That it not falter.
/93:2 Your Throne 
Is prepared from the farthest past. 
You have been before 
There was a world.

/93:3 The currents raise their roar, 
The rivers raise the spumes, 
The mighty torrents' thunder.
/93:4 The thunder of the ocean’s breakers: All exclaim, 
`Most powerful are You, {dn Yah!}' 
Oh, {dn Yah!} /93:5  Your creation 
witnesses You well. 
Of sacred beauty is Your house-- 
Through all of time.

Psalm 104}

{poetry}
/104:1 Bless {dn Yah,} breath of mine. 
{dn YAH,} {dn my God,} You are so vast and great, 
All veiled in pride and glory!

/104:2 You are wrapped in Light. 
The sky, You spread like a sheet.

/104:3 Your upper chambers are water roofed, 
As You bestride clouds. 
You waft on the wings of wind.

/104:4 The breezes, You send 
are Your aides, 
Your helpers, blazing flames.

/104:5 You founded Earth, so sound, 
To outlast time itself.

/104:6 The abyss, You covered like a mantle 
Water! On mountains rests.

/104:7 You sound a roar and they flee. 
Your thunder makes them shake.

/104:8 Mountains high and valleys low... 
Their places they assume.

/104:9 You set them limits they cannot pass. 
Never again to flood the land.

/104:10 Springs flow into brooks 
And snake between the mountains.

/104:11 All the wild of field drink there. 
The beasts slake there their thirst.

/104:12 By their shores dwell birds that soar, 
Sounding calls through leaves and reeds.

/104:13 You drench the hills 
From Your Upper Chambers. 

From your hands' produce 
The Earth is filled.

/104:14 You grow fodder for the tamed beasts, 
And herbs with human labor, 

To bring forth bread from Earth.
/104:15 And wine to delight the sad ones, 

And oil... that softens skin, 
And bread... that sustains the weak.

/104:16 Even the trees you sate with sap. 
The cedars You planted on the Lebanon.

/104:17 There, birds find their nesting. 
There, storks find homes to rest.

/104:18 Antelopes bound on the heights. 
Marmots hide behind rocks.

/104:19 The Moon pulls tides and seasons. 
The sun knows where to set.

/104:20 You darken dusk to night. 
The forest's night life stirs.

/104:21 The big cats cry for prey, 
Praying {dn God} for their food.

/104:22 They return at the rising of the sun, 
To crouch once more in lairs.

/104:23 While humans go out to work, 
To their toil, up to night.

/104:24 How many things You do! 
So wisely are they made. 
All Earth, at Your command.

/104:25 This vast sea beyond all grasp. 
Countless are the creatures in her, 
Tiny ones and giant whales.

/104:26 There go stately ships. 
This Leviathan You shaped 
To play and romp therein.

/104:27 They all rely on Your care, 
To feed them well each time.

/104:28 You give to them and they take it. 
Your hand's gifts sate them well.

/104:29 You hide your face, they panic. 
You recall their breaths, they die. 
They return to their dust.

/104:30 You send your spirit, 
And they are re-created. 
So too, You renew life on Earth.

/104:31 Let Your glory, {dn Yah,} fill time and space. 
Take Joy, O {dn Yah,} in what You do!

/104:32 You look at Earth and she trembles, 
Hills You touch, and they smoke.

/104:33 I live Your song, my {dn Yah,} 
{dn My Yah,} I am Your tune.

/104:34 Let my talking give You joy. 
I am so happy, {dn my Yah!}

/104:35 I wish no sin exist on Earth. 
All wickedness were gone. 

Bless that {dn Yah,} my soul, my breath.

My trust in You is firm.

I want to be at home with You, {dn Yah,}

I want to delight in seeing You, 
When I come to visit You in Your Temple.

You conceal me unseen in Your tent 
And also raise me beyond anyone’s reach.
/27:6 And now, as You have held my head high, 
Despite the presence of my powerful foes, 
I prepare to celebrate and thrill, 
Singing and making music to You, {dn Yah!}
/27:7 Listen, {dn Yah,} to the sound of my cry 
And, being kind, answer me.

Don’t abandon me, don’t forsake me,

You, {dn Yah,} will hold me securely.
/27:11 Please teach me Your way 
And guide me on the straight path. 
Discourage those who defame me.
/27:12 False witnesses stood up against me, 
Belching out violence. 
Don’t let me become the victim of my foes.

If I had not hoped that I would yet see 
{dn Yah’s} goodness fully alive on Earth.

Each one who aligns oneself every day with these principles of the faith and lives according to them can be assured that s\/he will have a role in the World to Come for us and for all the peoples on the entire world soon:
1. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith in the {dn G‑d} who is infinite and the blessed light that issues from that Infinite Source, who is beyond time and space, yet who longs to have a dwelling place among those in the worlds here below; and who, out of loving beneficence to Her creatures, contracted Her light and Her radiant glory, in order to emanate, to create, to form, and to effectuate all that exists in the universe.
2. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith in the Oneness of {dn G‑d} and of all creation, a oneness of the kind of One that has no second; and that all which exists in the universe exists solely according to the will of that {dn G‑d}, who constantly calls everything into being – who causes all existence at every moment.
3. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that the Creator has an intent and a purpose in creation, and that one of the aspects of that purpose is so that He shall become known to us by and through it; and that we, creatures have a task to broaden and enlarge that knowledge\/awareness until the world will be as filled with knowledge of {dn G‑d} as the waters cover the sea.
4. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that the hoped‑for goal is that all of us will come to constitute one united interconnected and organic whole and that every living being will know that You are the One who constantly causes its existence.
5. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that all the pathways through which the Holy Spirit is manifest and revealed are of one piece with the Torah that was given at Sinai.
6. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith in the mission of Judaism, which is one of the vital organs of the collective being that comprises all existence, and that through {dn G‑d's} compassion on all creatures, it is revealed to them also how indispensable and integral they are to the health of all the species of the planet.
7. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that the universe is not ownerless and abandoned, and that every one who does good with his\/her life takes part in the fixing on the world and that every one who uses his\/her life for evil participates in the destruction of the world; and that every action has an impact on the rest of existence.
8. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that the amount of good in the world is greater than the amount of evil, and that the entire order of movement through the chain of evolution is designed to bring about the fulfillment of the Divine intention.
9. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that the deeds of the fathers and mothers accrue to the benefit of the children, and that the tradition that is passed on contains within it the seeds of the light of redemption.
10. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that our prayers are heard and answered.
11. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith that the Holy {translit he-Latn "Shechinah"} dwells within our midst and that all who show kindness to living creatures show kindness too to the {translit he-Latn "Sh’khinnah,"} and vice versa.
12. May it be the divine will that I believe with perfect faith that physical death does not terminate the existence of the soul; rather, that there are innumerable worlds, within which they return to live again.
13. May it be the Divine will that I believe with perfect faith in {translit he-Latn "Tikkun HaOlam,"} that the world can be repaired and healed and that it is becoming alive; and that besides coming to life, the world will come to possess a consciousness and feeling, and as such will become a fitting vessel for a fuller revelation of the Divine will.

Rabbi Elimelech’s prayer to be able to pray}

{poetry}
{dn Yah,} {dn our God,}  
You are our parents {dn God,} 
You are open to hear our pleading prayer 
with compassion.  
You give a caring ear 
to what Your people Israel is crying for.  
This is our prayer to You, 
please grant it.

Open our hearts, 
focus our thoughts, 
help that our prayers 
may flow freely from our lips 
and incline Your ear to hear
how we, Your servants 
are seeking Your favor, 
crying in a pleading voice 
and with a shattered spirit.

You, kind compassionate One
{dn God} of infinite mercy!  
Please forgive us, pardon us 
and atone 
for us and for Your entire people, 
the house of Israel, 
so that what ever we have failed 
to do right 
or what we have done wrong 
or when we acted in ways 
that are wicked
and rebelled against You. 
be forgiven, pardoned and atoned 
for us and for Your entire people, 
the house of Israel, 

How well You know, 
and it is apparent to You 
that it was not with malice or willfulness 
that we transgressed what You teach us,
what You command us  
in Your {translit he-Latn "Torah"} and Commandments.  

In our bellies 
there burns a fire without ceasing, 
a {translit he-Latn "Yetzer Hara,"} the drive of selfishness 
which draws us 
to the vices of this world 
and its follies.  
The {translit he-Latn "Yetzer"} confuses our awareness, 
even when we stand before You 
seeking to pray and plead for our lives.  
The {translit he-Latn "Yetzer’s"} incitement 
constantly confuses our thoughts 
with all sorts of thoughts and schemes.  
We cannot resist it; 
for our awareness is uncertain
our mind unsteady 
the troubles and preoccupations 
of making a living 
under times of oppression 
bear down heavily on us.  

Therefore, You, 
who are compassionate and kind 
fulfill for us what You promised 
to Moses, Your faithful servant; 
When You said, 
`I will favor whomever I will favor 
and I will be compassionate 
on whomever I will be compassionate.'
And this You had our sages tell us
This applies even to those 
who are not worthy
for this is Your way;
to be kind both to those who are bad 
and those who are good.

It must be obvious to You
how we are troubled
how hard our life is
and what we must bear –
it is so difficult for us
to come near to You
and to serve You well,
to have our feelings be sincerely
in harmony with Your will.
Dear Father in heaven!
What pain we feel in our souls!
Please arouse Your mercy and kindness
freely and abundantly 
and banish, erase
our attraction to evil.
Let not our evil {translit he-Latn "Yetzer"}
be active in our innards.
Let him not seduce us
let him not deflect us from serving You

May no evil schemes arise in our heart
when we are asleep or awake
especially at that time 
when we stand in prayer before You
or are at times 
when we study Your holy {translit he-Latn "Torah"}
or at times when we are busy 
fulfilling Your Commandments.
Then let our thoughts be pure and clear,
our own awareness steady and strong,
sincere and heartfelt
as You would have us be.

Awaken in our hearts 
and in the hearts of all of Israel, 
Your people,
the aim to unify You
in all truth, in all love,
so to serve
as to be pleasing to You.

Fasten in us 
such a steadfast faith in You, 
To be so deeply anchored 
in our hearts as
not to vacillate from it.

Remove from us all the barriers 
that separate us from You,  
Our father in heaven.
Save us from stumbling in our path,
Keep us from going astray.

Don't forsake us,
don't abandon us,
keep us from disgracing 
You before the world.

Be present to us 
in the words of our prayer
May the work of our hands
and the thoughts of our hearts 
serve You
as we think of You

Please, our Father in heaven
In Your abundant kindness 
Grant us the boon 
that our thoughts 
and words and actions, 
all our motives and our feelings
those we are aware of 
and those near not aware of 
those that are manifest 
and those that are hidden
with all of them together 
be unified in sincerity and truth
without any self deception.

Purify our hearts,
sanctify us,
sprinkle us with Thy cleansing water 
to purify us,
wash us clean 
with Your kindness and love.
Plant Your steadfast love, 
and Your awe in our hearts
at all times
and in all places
as we go about our lives whether
we lie down or get up;
that there always be Your Holy Spirit 
ardently active in our innards 
that we may rely on You always,
on Your greatness, 
Your love and Your awe.

May we be securely anchored
in Your written and Oral {translit he-Latn "Torah"}
in the part of the Torah 
that is open to all
and the part of {translit he-Latn "Torah"} that is hidden.
In doing the {translit he-Latn "mitzvoth"}
may we unify Your awesome Name.
Protect us from hypocrisy,
from pride, anger, and vindictiveness
from depression, from tale bearing
and other vices.
Protect us from everything
that might damage 
the holiness and purity
of our service to You, whom we love.

Pour out thy Holy Spirit over us
that we may stay close to You,
that our longing for You may
grow and increase.
Raise us up from rung to rung
that we might come close to the rung of
our holy forebears
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

We know
You will always receive our prayer;
You will always answer us
when we pray for anyone, 
be it a single person 
or the whole people Israel.
May You take joy in us
May Your glory be reflected in us.

May our prayers bear fruit
and be fulfilled, above and below.
Help us to attend to our flaws,
especially the sins of our youth
as King David, peace be upon him, said
`my youthful sins and my rebellions
do not keep in Your memory.'
Please, enable us to turn from our sins 
and rebellions.
Let there flow to us 
from the realm of repentance
the challenging call 
to return to You wholeheartedly
and to repair all that we have damaged 
of Your pure and holy Name.

{dn Yah,} rescue us from envy.
Let not jealousy 
of any person arise in our hearts
and let not others be vindictive to us,
on the contrary, place into our hearts
appreciation for the goodness 
of our fellow beings.
Let us not seek to find fault with them.
May we speak to each person 
with civility and gentleness.
Let not hatred arise from one to another.
Strengthen us 
that we might love You more
for You know well how our intention is 
that it all should bring You
pleasure and joy,
for this is the root of our intention
despite the fact 
that we don't have a strong enough mind
to keep the aim of the {translit he-Latn "kavanah"}
of our heart, 
focused on You.

Enlighten us so that we might learn 
to fully know Your good purpose.

I affirm the model of our ancestor's rest, and sanctification of {translit he-Latn "Shabbat."}
I affirm the perfection of what is in the world, and I surrender all the urgings

{he י} You who love my soul,
Compassion’s gentle source,
Take my guiding motives
And shape them to Your will.
Like a darting deer
I will flee to You.
Before Your glorious Presence
Humbly I do bow.
Let Your sweet love
Delight me with its thrill,
Because no other dainty
Will my hunger still.

{he ה} How splendid is Your light.
Which worlds do reflect!
My soul is worn from craving
For Your love’s delight.
Please, good {dn G-d}, do heal her
And show to her Your face,
So my soul can see You
And bathe in Your grace.
There she will find strength
And healing in this sight.
Her joy will be complete then
Eternal her delight.

{he ו} What pity stirs in You
Since days of old, my {dn G-d}!
Be kind to me Your own child
Begotten by Your love.
For long and longing hours
I yearned for your embrace
To see my light in Your light
Basking in Your grace.
My heart’s desire is
To harmonize with Yours
Do not conceal Your pity
Hide not that light of Yours.

{he ה} Help, my Lover, spread
Your canopy of peace,
Enfold all human beings
Give all pain surcease.
Your presence on this earth plane
Do make known to us
And we shall respond then
With song and with dance.
Rush, my love, be quick,
The time for love is now,
Let Your gentle favor
Grace us as of old.

I chant to please You, 
I weave You dear songs.
For You my soul yearns, 
For You she longs.
Nestled in Your palm 
her love for You grows
She will not rest 
until it’s You she knows!
I look for words 
to speak Your praises
my heart to You 
its yearning raises.
Therefore I will speak 
the virtues of Your Fame
And garland with excellence 
the honor of Your Name.
Though I do not see You, 
still I draw Your Face,
Portray Your features, 
name Your Place.
Your prophets spoke, 
Your servants darkly knew
In symbols and myths 
they referred to You.
When describing Your pow’r 
and declaring Your care
Of Your awesome compassion 
they made us aware.
Yet it is not Your Being 
that they could describe
Only the way Your compassion 
touches our life.
Countless their visions 
of Your mysterious feats
In all their forms 
Your ONEness meets.
They saw You young; 
they saw You old.
They saw You patient, 
They saw You bold.
Ancient of Days, 
Eternally Just, 
Each moment our Helper 
in Whom we do trust. 
Wearing Your helmet 
as hero to help us
Your strong arm, 
Your right hand to save us.
Your hair drenched with light drops, 
all shining with brilliance.
Your Darkness is shelter, 
Your love in all radiance.
How fair is Your kindness, 
how splendid Your sight
May our song rise to crown You 
with endearing delight
A jewel all golden 
Your image sends rays
with t’fillin on forehead 
we follow Your ways.
With grace and honor, 
all splendid in glory
Your people sing loudly 
Your triumphal story
In words of young lovers 
they gaze at Your visage
the letters of Torah in black 
hold Your message.
Justice Your mantle 
in balance with kindness
This gives You pleasure 
delight and sublimeness.
May we deserve to be scepter 
in Your regal hand
A crimson royal cape, 
we Your loyal band.
The burdened sufferers, 
You sustained them with might
How precious You held them, 
so dear to Your sight.
Your glory my pride is, 
my delight for Your care
So close You are, 
to answer my pray’r.
Your shining face 
illumines my days
I am awed by the magic 
revealed in Your ways.
To Moshe You showed 
Your Head {translit he-Latn "T’fillin’s"} knot
Your image was clear 
in his mind and his thought.
Though humble Your folk, 
they are Your proud fame
You’re enthroned on their praises; 
they honor Your Name.
Truth is Your Word, 
enduring its worth
From parent to child 
its message flows forth.
I cannot sing 
Your praises complete,
May those that I do sing 
and reach You be sweet.
Like perfume and incense 
may my singing rise high
A paean to crown You, 
a poor lover’s sigh.
My poor song devoid is 
of all artifice
still this loving song 
is my best sacrifice.
My blessings are lifting 
to rise to new heights,
To make fertile the birth 
of the {translit he-Latn "Tzaddik"} with might.
And with these blessings, 
these love words so fond.
With a nod of Your head, 
I ask You: Respond. 
Regard please these poor words 
that I blush to recite
My soul’s ardent longing 
to give You delight.

Psalm 104}

{poetry}
/104:1 Bless {dn Yah,} breath of mine. 
{dn YAH,} {dn my God,} You are so vast and great, 
All veiled in pride and glory!

/104:2 You are wrapped in Light. 
The sky, You spread like a sheet.

/104:3 Your upper chambers are water roofed, 
As You bestride clouds. 
You waft on the wings of wind.

/104:4 The breezes, You send 
are Your aides, 
Your helpers, blazing flames.

/104:5 You founded Earth, so sound, 
To outlast time itself.

/104:6 The abyss, You covered like a mantle 
Water! On mountains rests.

/104:7 You sound a roar and they flee. 
Your thunder makes them shake.

/104:8 Mountains high and valleys low... 
Their places they assume.

/104:9 You set them limits they cannot pass. 
Never again to flood the land.

/104:10 Springs flow into brooks 
And snake between the mountains.

/104:11 All the wild of field drink there. 
The beasts slake there their thirst.

/104:12 By their shores dwell birds that soar, 
Sounding calls through leaves and reeds.

/104:13 You drench the hills 
From Your Upper Chambers. 

From your hands' produce 
The Earth is filled.

/104:14 You grow fodder for the tamed beasts, 
And herbs with human labor, 

To bring forth bread from Earth.
/104:15 And wine to delight the sad ones, 

And oil... that softens skin, 
And bread... that sustains the weak.

/104:16 Even the trees you sate with sap. 
The cedars You planted on the Lebanon.

/104:17 There, birds find their nesting. 
There, storks find homes to rest.

/104:18 Antelopes bound on the heights. 
Marmots hide behind rocks.

/104:19 The Moon pulls tides and seasons. 
The sun knows where to set.

/104:20 You darken dusk to night. 
The forest's night life stirs.

/104:21 The big cats cry for prey, 
Praying {dn God} for their food.

/104:22 They return at the rising of the sun, 
To crouch once more in lairs.

/104:23 While humans go out to work, 
To their toil, up to night.

/104:24 How many things You do! 
So wisely are they made. 
All Earth, at Your command.

/104:25 This vast sea beyond all grasp. 
Countless are the creatures in her, 
Tiny ones and giant whales.

/104:26 There go stately ships. 
This {translit he-Latn "Leviathan"} You shaped 
To play and romp therein.

/104:27 They all rely on Your care, 
To feed them well each time.

/104:28 You give to them and they take it. 
Your hand's gifts sate them well.

/104:29 You hide your face, they panic. 
You recall their breaths, they die. 
They return to their dust.

/104:30 You send your spirit, 
And they are re-created. 
So too, You renew life on Earth.

/104:31 Let Your glory, {dn Yah,} fill time and space. 
Take Joy, O {dn Yah,} in what You do!

/104:32 You look at Earth and she trembles, 
Hills You touch, and they smoke.

/104:33 I live Your song, my {dn Yah,} 
My {dn Yah,} I am Your tune.

/104:34 Let my talking give You joy. 
I am so happy, my {dn Yah!}

/104:35 I wish no sin exist on Earth. 
All wickedness were gone. 

Bless that {dn Yah,} my soul, my breath.

/139:1 Conductor – David's prayer set to music.
{dn Yah!} You have scanned me 
And discerned me.
/139:2 You know when I am relaxed 
or agitated. 
From afar 
You comprehend my fantasies.
/139:3 You design my conduct and my repose. 
You direct my paths so I can manage.

/139:4 Before my mouth opens 
You know what I am about to say.
/139:5 You have shaped my past and my future. 
Your hand, gently on my shoulder.

/139:6 All this awes my awareness. 
It is beyond my skills to fathom.

/139:7 Whereto can I withdraw from Your spirit? 
Flee from facing You?

/139:8 If I would mount up to Heaven 
There are You. 
If I make my bed in Hell 
You are there too.

/139:9 Soaring on the wings of the dawn, 
To find shelter in the setting sun, 
/139:10 It would be Your hand, 
that would carry me, 
Your right hand, holding me safe.

/139:11 If I want to find oblivion in darkness, 
Trading light for darkness, 
/139:12 To You, it would still not be dark.
Night is as bright as day for You. 
Dark and light – the same in Your sight.
/139:13 You have designed my innards, 
shaped me in the my mother's womb.
/139:14 I am overcome with thanks 
At Your awesome wonders, 
Your astonishing works, 
Of which my soul is aware.
/139:15 My essence is not hidden from You, 
Who have made me in concealment, 
Who has knitted me beneath the surface.

/139:16 Your eyes have seen me as embryo. 
My days – are all inscribed 
in Your ledger – 
Days not yet shaped – 
each one of them counted.

/139:17 How precious are Your stirrings 
in me Oh {dn God!}
How powerful their impact!
/139:18 I can't number them – 
beyond all sand grains. 
When I emerge from my reflection 
I am still with You.

/139:19 If You, {dn God,} would only rid us 
from our evil! 
If only the cruelty would disappear!
/139:20 And defiance of You vanish, 
Forgiveness overtaking enmity!

/139:21 I detest hatred of You – {dn Yah!} 
Quarrelsomeness repels me.
/139:22 I loathe hostility to the utmost.

/139:23 {dn God!} I open myself to Your scrutiny. 
Know what is in my heart. 
Examine and know my longings.
/139:24 See and remove any defiance from me 
And guide me in the way 
that serves Your intent for our Earth.

Beyond endless Time

You are Divine
Only You are the One who

You, You alone secure our lives.

You shielded us from wars and plagues
From diseases of body and mind
You pulled us out.

We never lacked Your kindness

with praise and celebration

so majestic, that is Your fame!

Our speech is appreciation
our expression an oath of loyalty
our attitude surrender
our stance before You obedience
our feelings overwhelming awe
our inners singing scales of Your Names
As it is in Scripture:
All my very essence exclaims:
{dn Yah!} Who? Like You?
You inspire the gentle

No other can claim to be what You are
No other can pretend to be

So we will keep celebrating

Don't let Your cravings delude You;
don't become alienated;
don't let Your cravings 
become Your Gods;
don't debase Yourself to them,
/11:17 because the God-sense within You
will become distorted.
Heaven will be shut to You,
grace will not descend,
Earth will not yield her produce.
Your rushing will destroy You!
And Earth will not be able 
to recover her good balance
in which {dn God's} gifts manifest.

/11:18 May these values of Mine reside
in Your feelings and aspirations:
marking what You produce,
guiding what You perceive.
/11:19 Teach them to Your children
so that they are instructed
how to make their homes sacred;
and how they deal with traffic.

(<I>May these values of Mine reside
in Your feelings and aspirations</I>)
even when You are depressed,
and when You are elated.

/11:20 Mark Your entrances and exits 
with them,
so You will be more aware.

/11:21 Then, You and Your children 
and their children,
will live out on earth
that divine promise 
given to Your ancestors
to live heavenly days
right here on this earth. –

/15:37 <I>{dn Yah who Is,} said to Moses</I>
/15:38 `Speak, telling the Israel folks
to make {translit he-Latn "tzitzit"}
on the corners of their garments,
so they will have generations
to follow them.
On each {translit he-Latn "tzizit"} tassel let them set
a blue thread.
/15:39 These {translit he-Latn "tzitzit"} are for Your benefit!
Glance at them.
And in Your seeing remember
all the other directives of {dn Yah who Is,}
and act on them!
This way You will not be led astray,
craving to see and want
and then prostitute Yourself
for Your cravings.
/15:40 This way You will be mindful
to actualize my directions
for becoming dedicated to {dn Your God;}
to be aware that
/15:41 I Am {dn Yah Who is} {dn Your God,} 
Who is the one who freed You
from oppression
in order to {dn God} You.
I am {dn Yah who is} {dn Your God.} '

That is the truth! –

This is what came from {dn Yah’s} mouth.

May it please You, {dn God,} 
that we see the day 
when all beings 
who are weary and exhausted find rest – 
then all of us will be fulfilled 
and blissful recipients 
of Your goodness. 
That seventh day
that you have signified and sanctified, 
the most delightful of days 
You have called it so we may

{dn El Shaddai} bless you,
Make you fruitful, give you the increase,
that will become a
source of harmony for people.

From {dn El,} your parents' {dn God,} help for you!
From {dn Shaddai,} all the blessings;
Sky blessings from above,
Blessings from the deepest strata below,
Blessings of fertility and nurture.

May {dn G-d} fulfill the blessing
to Abraham in you, 
and in your loved ones,
along with you.
Wherever, like Abraham,
you once were a stranger there, 
in that place, 
may you be at home.
Blessings of your parents (Jacob),
to add more force
to those of their parents,
(Isaac and Abraham),
to cap the desires of the ancient hills,
be they upon your head (Joseph),
and surround the heads of your siblings.
{dn God} loves You.
{dn God} blesses and increases you.
{dn God} blesses your family and your land,
your income and your holdings,
right here on Earth,
as {dn God} promised your parents.
All peoples will bless you.
You and your possessions,
will all prosper.
May {dn God} remove all illness and pain,
all tensions and pressures
you have known...

The angel who redeemed me,
from all that was corrupt,
may that one bless these children.
May my name, 
that of Abraham and Isaac,
be associated with theirs.

Be blessed in the city.
Be blessed in the country.
Blessed as you arrive,
Blessed as you are leaving.

{dn God} decree for you blessing
in what you have stored up
for yourself from before,
through your hands' work now,
right here on Earth.
This be your gift from {dn God.}
May {dn God} open for you,
treasures of heavenly goodness,
of earthly timeliness,
to succeed in what you do.
May you have good credit,
and not need it.
{dn God} be with you and help you 
at all times.
May you not ever
have to feel shame or blame.

Go in joy, arrive in peace.
Mountains and hills sing you on your way.
Trees in the meadows applaud your trip.
Draw waters of Joy
from the source of help.
May you live to the day
that {dn God} be so present,
the way we hoped, {dn Yah,}
to be present to us all along,
a real help in our lives!
How we will then celebrate
{dn God's} helpfulness!
