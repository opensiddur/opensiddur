         <h2>FIRST KINGS</h2>
         
         
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 1
         </h3>Now King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Wherefore his servants said unto him: ‘Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand before the
         king, and be a companion unto him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to
         the king. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the damsel was very fair; and she became a companion unto the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: ‘I will be king’; and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
         fifty men to run before him. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And his father had not grieved him all his life in saying: ‘Why hast thou done so?’ and he was also a very goodly man; and
         he was born after Absalom. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they following Adonijah helped him. <span class="verse-number">8</span>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that
         belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And Adonijah slew sheep 
         and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren the king’s sons,
         and all the men of Judah the king’s servants; <span class="verse-number">10</span>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then Nathan spoke unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying: ‘Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth
         reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? <span class="verse-number">12</span>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
         Solomon. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying: Assuredly
         Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? <span class="verse-number">14</span>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber.—Now the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
         the king.—<span class="verse-number">16</span>And Bath-sheba bowed, and prostrated herself unto the king. And the king said: ‘What wouldest thou?’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And she said unto him: ‘My lord, 
         
         
         
         
         thou didst swear by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God unto thy handmaid: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar, the priest,
         and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne
         of my lord the king after him. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted
         offenders.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And they told the king, saying: ‘Behold Nathan the prophet.’ And when he was come in before the king, he bowed down before
         the king with his face to the ground. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And Nathan said: ‘My lord, O king, hast thou said: Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? <span class="verse-number">25</span>For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons,
         and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say: Long live king
         Adonijah. <span class="verse-number">26</span>But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son 
         of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon hath he not called. <span class="verse-number">27</span>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord
         the king after him?’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">28</span>Then king David answered and said: ‘Call me Bath-sheba.’ And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>And the king swore and said: ‘As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, <span class="verse-number">30</span>verily as I swore unto thee by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead;
         verily so will I do this day.’ <span class="verse-number">31</span>Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and prostrated herself to the king, and said: ‘Let my lord king David live
         for ever.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">32</span>And king David said: ‘Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.’ And they came before
         the king. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And the king said unto them: ‘Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule,
         and bring him down to Gihon. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the horn, and say: Long
         live king Solomon. <span class="verse-number">35</span>Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed
         him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.’ <span class="verse-number">36</span>And Benaiah the son of 
         
         
         
         
         Jehoiada answered the king, and said: ‘Amen; so say the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of my lord the king. <span class="verse-number">37</span>As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath been with my lord the king, even so be He with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king
         David.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">38</span>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went
         down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. <span class="verse-number">39</span>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the ram’s horn; and all the
         people said: ‘Long live king Solomon.’ <span class="verse-number">40</span>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent
         with the sound of them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">41</span>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
         of the horn, he said: ‘Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?’ <span class="verse-number">42</span>While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said: ‘Come in; for thou art a worthy
         man, and bringest good tidings.’ <span class="verse-number">43</span>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah: ‘Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. <span class="verse-number">44</span>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites
         and the Pelethites, and 
         they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule. <span class="verse-number">45</span>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
         that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that ye have heard. <span class="verse-number">46</span>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. <span class="verse-number">47</span>And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying: God make the name of Solomon better than thy name,
         and make his throne greater than thy throne; and the king bowed down upon the bed. <span class="verse-number">48</span>And also thus said the king: Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">49</span>And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. <span class="verse-number">50</span>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <span class="verse-number">51</span>And it was told Solomon, saying: ‘Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar,
         saying: Let king Solomon swear unto me first of all that he will not slay his servant with the sword.’ <span class="verse-number">52</span>And Solomon said: ‘If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness
         be found in him, he shall die.’ <span class="verse-number">53</span>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before king Solomon; and
         Solomon said unto him: ‘Go to thy house.’  
         
         
         
         
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 2
         </h3>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying: <span class="verse-number">2</span>‘I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; <span class="verse-number">3</span>and keep the charge of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His ordinances, and His testimonies, according
         to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest
         thyself; <span class="verse-number">4</span>that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> may establish His word which He spoke concerning me, saying: If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me in
         truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee, said He, a man on the throne of Israel. <span class="verse-number">5</span>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
         Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
         put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. <span class="verse-number">7</span>But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they drew
         nigh unto me when I fled from Absalom thy brother. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of 
         Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan,
         and I swore to him by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: I will not put thee to death with the sword. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou
         shalt bring his hoar head down to the grave with blood.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
         reigned he in Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established firmly.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said: ‘Comest thou peaceably?’ And he said:
         ‘Peaceably.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>He said moreover: ‘I have somewhat to say unto thee.’ And she said: ‘Say on.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And he said: ‘Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign; howbeit
         the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not.’ And she said unto him: ‘Say on.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said: ‘Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king—for he will not say thee nay—that he give me Abishag the Shunammite
         to wife.’ 
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>And Bath-sheba said: ‘Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed down
         unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.
         <span class="verse-number">20</span>Then she said: ‘I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not.’ And the king said unto her: ‘Ask on, my mother; for I will
         not deny thee.’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>And she said: ‘Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother: ‘And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
         the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.’
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>Then king Solomon swore by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: ‘God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Now therefore as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as He promised,
         surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king: ‘Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art deserving of death;
         but I will not at this time put 
         thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span> before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; that the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> might be fulfilled, which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">28</span>And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the
         Tent of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And it was told king Solomon: ‘Joab is fled unto the Tent of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and, behold, he is by the altar.’ Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying: ‘Go, fall upon him.’ <span class="verse-number">30</span>And Benaiah came to the Tent of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the king: Come forth.’ And he said: ‘Nay; but I will die here.’ And Benaiah brought back
         word unto the king, saying: ‘Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.’ <span class="verse-number">31</span>And the king said unto him: ‘Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which
         Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with
         the sword, and my father David knew it not: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,
         captain of the host of Judah. <span class="verse-number">33</span>So shall 
         
         
         
         
         their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto
         his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">34</span>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
         <span class="verse-number">35</span>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room
         of Abiathar.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">36</span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth
         thence any whither. <span class="verse-number">37</span>For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood
         shall be upon thine own head.’ <span class="verse-number">38</span>And Shimei said unto the king: ‘The saying is good; as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.’ And Shimei dwelt
         in Jerusalem many days.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">39</span>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king
         of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying: ‘Behold, thy servants are in Gath.’ <span class="verse-number">40</span>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his
         servants from Gath. <span class="verse-number">41</span>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come back. <span class="verse-number">42</span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and 
         said unto him: ‘Did I not make thee to swear by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and forewarned thee, saying: Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt
         surely die? and thou saidst unto me: The saying is good; I have heard it. <span class="verse-number">43</span>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?’ <span class="verse-number">44</span>The king said moreover to Shimei: ‘Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my
         father; therefore the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head. <span class="verse-number">45</span>But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> for ever.’ <span class="verse-number">46</span>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died.

         of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> until those days. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Solomon loved the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, walking in the statutes of David his father; only he sacrificed and offered in the high places.  
         
         
         
         
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place; a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon
         offer upon that altar. <span class="verse-number">5</span>In Gibeon the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said: ‘Ask what I shall give thee.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Solomon said: ‘Thou hast shown unto Thy servant David my father great kindness, according as he walked before Thee in
         truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with Thee; and Thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that Thou
         hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And now, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out
         or come in. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people which Thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
         for multitude. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Give Thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge Thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is
         able to judge this Thy great people?’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the speech pleased the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that Solomon had asked this thing. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And God said unto him: ‘Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches
         for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice; <span class="verse-number">12</span>behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and 
         an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour—so that there hath not been any among the
         kings like unto thee—all thy days. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And if thou wilt walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen
         thy days.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream; and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the one woman said: ‘Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
         house. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was
         no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlay it. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her
         dead child in my bosom. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked well at it in the morning,
         
         
         
         
         
         behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>And the other woman said: ‘Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son.’ And this said: ‘No; but the dead is thy
         son, and the living is my son.’ Thus they spoke before the king.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>Then said the king: ‘The one saith: This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead; and the other saith: Nay; but thy
         son is the dead, and my son is the living.’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the king said: ‘Fetch me a sword.’ And they brought a sword before the king. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And the king said: ‘Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.’ <span class="verse-number">26</span>Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned upon her son, and she said: ‘Oh, my lord,
         give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.’ But the other said: ‘It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>Then the king answered and said: ‘Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.’ <span class="verse-number">28</span>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of
         God was in him, to do justice.

         the midst of the house. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within
         and without. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And for the 
         entrance of the Sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood, the door-posts within the frame having five angles. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And as for the two doors of olive-wood, he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid
         them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees. <span class="verse-number">33</span>So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, within a frame four-square; <span class="verse-number">34</span>and two doors of cypress-wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
         <span class="verse-number">35</span>And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.
         <span class="verse-number">36</span>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.

         <span class="verse-number">37</span>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> laid, in the month Ziv. <span class="verse-number">38</span>And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof,

         <h3>
            									Chapter 7
         </h3>And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon: the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,
         and the height thereof 
         
         
         
         
         thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, that lay on forty and five pillars, fifteen in a row. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And there were beams in three rows; and light was over against light in three ranks. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And all the doors with their posts were square in the frame; and light was over against light in three ranks.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And he made the porch of pillars: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch
         before them; and pillars and thick beams before them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And he made the porch of the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor
         to floor.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And his house where he might dwell, in the other court, within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s
         daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife, like unto this porch.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from
         the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And above were costly stones, after the measure of hewn stones, and cedar-wood. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone, and a row of 
         cedar beams, like as the inner court of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the court of the porch of the house.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. <span class="verse-number">14</span>He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled
         with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>Thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high each; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it about;
         [and so] the other pillar. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits,
         and the height of the other capital was five cubits. <span class="verse-number">17</span>He also made nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars: seven
         for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the
         top of the pomegranates; and so did he for the other capital. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network; and the pomegranates
         were two hundred, in rows round about upon each capital. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And he set up the pillars 
         
         
         
         
         at the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar,
         and called the name thereof Boaz. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; so was the work of the pillars finished.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and
         a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about;
         the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast. <span class="verse-number">25</span>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
         south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And it was a hand-breadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held
         two thousand baths.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three
         cubits the height of it. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders; and there were borders between the stays; <span class="verse-number">29</span>and on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the stays it was in like manner above;
         and beneath the 
         lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters; beneath the laver were
         the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit high; and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal,
         a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings; and their borders were foursquare, not round. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And the four wheels were underneath the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel
         was a cubit and half a cubit. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and
         their naves, were all molten. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base; the undersetters thereof were of one piece with the base
         itself. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and
         the borders thereof were of one piece therewith. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to
         the space of each, with wreaths round about. <span class="verse-number">37</span>After this manner he made the ten bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">38</span>And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and 
         
         
         
         
         every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. <span class="verse-number">39</span>And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the
         right side of the house eastward, toward the south.

         two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; <span class="verse-number">42</span>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls
         of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; <span class="verse-number">43</span>and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases; <span class="verse-number">44</span>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea; <span class="verse-number">45</span>and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, were of burnished brass. <span class="verse-number">46</span>In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. <span class="verse-number">47</span>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many; the weight of the brass could not be found out.
         <span class="verse-number">48</span>And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: the 
         golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold; <span class="verse-number">49</span>and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, and
         the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; <span class="verse-number">50</span>and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the
         doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, of gold.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">51</span>Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,
         and put them in the treasuries of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 8
         </h3>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’houses of the children
         of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> out of the city of David, which is Zion. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh
         month. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And they brought up the ark of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring
         up. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were 
         
         
         
         
         assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. <span class="verse-number">7</span>For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof
         above. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary; but they
         could not be seen without; and there they are unto this day. <span class="verse-number">9</span>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, <span class="verse-number">11</span>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>

         a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel. <span class="verse-number">17</span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span class="verse-number">18</span>But the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto David my father: Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for My name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart;
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
         for My name. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath established His word that He spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel,
         as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> promised, and have built the house for the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which He made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>And Solomon stood before the altar of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; <span class="verse-number">23</span>and he said: ‘O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, there is no God like Thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with

         and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them; <span class="verse-number">51</span>for they are Thy people, and Thine inheritance, which Thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of
         iron; <span class="verse-number">52</span>that Thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken
         unto them whensoever they cry unto Thee. <span class="verse-number">53</span>For Thou didst set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth, to be Thine 
         
         
         
         
         inheritance, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, when Thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">54</span>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he arose from before the altar of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. <span class="verse-number">55</span>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying: <span class="verse-number">56</span>‘Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that hath given rest unto His people Israel, according to all that He promised; there hath not failed one word of all His
         good promise, which He promised by the hand of Moses His servant. <span class="verse-number">57</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; let Him not leave us, nor forsake us; <span class="verse-number">58</span>that He may incline our hearts unto Him, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and His statutes, and His
         ordinances, which He commanded our fathers. <span class="verse-number">59</span>And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, be nigh unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God day and night, that He maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, as every day shall
         require; <span class="verse-number">60</span>that all the peoples of the earth may know that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, He is God; there is none else. <span class="verse-number">61</span>Let your heart therefore be whole with the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, as at this day.’ <span class="verse-number">62</span>And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the 
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">63</span>And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated
         the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">64</span>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the brazen altar
         that was before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">65</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance Hamath unto the Brook
         of Egypt, before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. <span class="verse-number">66</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for
         all the goodness that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had shown unto David His servant, and to Israel His people.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 9
         </h3>And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s delight which he was pleased to do, <span class="verse-number">2</span>that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared unto him at Gibeon. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto him: ‘I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before Me: I have hallowed this 
         
         
         
         
         house, which thou hast built, to put My name there for ever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do
         according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep My statutes and Mine ordinances; <span class="verse-number">5</span>then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever; according as I promised to David thy father, saying:
         There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. <span class="verse-number">6</span>But if ye shall turn away from following Me, ye or your children, and not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have
         set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; <span class="verse-number">7</span>then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for My name, will
         I cast out of My sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all peoples; <span class="verse-number">8</span>and this house which is so high [shall become desolate], and every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss;
         and when they shall say: Why hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> done thus unto this land, and to this house? <span class="verse-number">9</span>they shall be answered: Because they forsook the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
         served them; therefore hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought all this evil upon them.’  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> and the king’s house—<span class="verse-number">11</span>now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and cypress-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire—that
         then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him: and they pleased him not. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And he said: ‘What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?’ And they were called the land of Cabul, unto this
         day. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised; to build the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city,
         and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, <span class="verse-number">18</span>and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, <span class="verse-number">19</span>and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which
         Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. <span class="verse-number">20</span>All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, 
         
         
         
         
         the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; <span class="verse-number">21</span>even their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of
         them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. <span class="verse-number">22</span>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes,
         and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>These were the chief officers that were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought
         in the work.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which [Solomon] had built for her; then did he build
         Millo.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">25</span>And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, offering thereby, upon the altar that was before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. So he finished the house. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.  And
         when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon 
         because of the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, she came to prove him with hard questions. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices and gold very much, and precious stones; and
         when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Solomon told her all her questions; there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, <span class="verse-number">5</span>and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his
         cupbearers, and his burnt-offering which he offered in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, there was no more spirit in her. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And she said to the king: ‘It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half was not told me; thou hast
         wisdom and prosperity exceeding the fame which I heard. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel; because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> loved Israel for ever, therefore made He thee king, to do justice and righteousness.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones; there 
         
         
         
         
         came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of sandal-wood and precious stones.
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the king made of the sandal-wood pillars for the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers; there came no such sandal-wood, nor was seen, unto
         this day. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his
         royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, <span class="verse-number">15</span>beside that which came of the merchants, and of the traffic of the traders, and of all the kings of the mingled people and
         of the governors of the country. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold: three pounds of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house
         of the forest of Lebanon.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. <span class="verse-number">19</span>There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were arms on either side by the
         place of the 
         seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>And all king Solomon’s drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
         gold; none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. <span class="verse-number">22</span>For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram; once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing
         gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armour, and spices, horses,
         and mules, a rate year by year.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
         horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland,
         for abundance. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; also out of Keveh, the king’s merchants buying 
         
         
         
         
         them of the men of Keveh at a price. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so
         for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Aram, did they bring them out by their means.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 11
         </h3>Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, besides the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians,
         and Hittites; <span class="verse-number">2</span>of the nations concerning which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto the children of Israel: ‘Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn
         away your heart after their gods’; Solomon did cleave unto these in love. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. <span class="verse-number">4</span>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not whole
         with the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> his God, as was the heart of David his father. <span class="verse-number">5</span>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and went not fully after the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, as did David his father. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the detestation of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech
         the detestation of the children of Ammon. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And so did he for 
         all his foreign wives, who offered and sacrificed unto their gods.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice, <span class="verse-number">10</span>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he kept not that which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Wherefore the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Solomon: ‘Forasmuch as this hath been in thy mind, and thou hast not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I
         have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son; for David My servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s
         sake which I have chosen.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king’s seed in Edom. <span class="verse-number">15</span>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten

         a little child. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh
         king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of
         Tahpenes the queen. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s
         house among the sons of Pharaoh. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said
         to Pharaoh: ‘Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then Pharaoh said unto him: ‘But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?’ And
         he answered: ‘Nothing; howbeit let me depart in any wise.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>And God raised up another adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them [of Zobah]; and they went to Damascus,
         and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and
         reigned over Aram.

         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he
         also lifted up his hand against the king. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city
         of David his father. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge
         over all the labour of the house of Joseph. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
         the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And he said to Jeroboam: ‘Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee—<span class="verse-number">32</span>but he shall have one tribe, for My servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all
         the tribes of Israel—<span class="verse-number">33</span>because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and
         Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and
         to keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his

         <span class="verse-number">40</span>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in
         Egypt until the death of Solomon.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">41</span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of
         Solomon? <span class="verse-number">42</span>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <span class="verse-number">43</span>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of 
         David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 12
         </h3>And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it—for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence
         of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt, <span class="verse-number">3</span>and they sent and called him—that Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke unto Rehoboam, saying: <span class="verse-number">4</span>‘Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
         put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he said unto them: ‘Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.’ And the people departed.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying: ‘What
         counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And they spoke unto him, saying: ‘If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them,
         and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up
         with him, that stood before him. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he said unto them: ‘What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying: Make
         the 
         
         
         
         
         yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spoke unto
         thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them: My little
         finger is thicker than my father’s loins. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And now whereas my father did burden you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but
         I will chastise you with scorpions.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying: ‘Come to me again the third day.’
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him; <span class="verse-number">14</span>and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying: ‘My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke;
         my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that He might establish His word, which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying: ‘What portion have we
         in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.’ So
         
         Israel departed unto their tents. <span class="verse-number">17</span>But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the levy; and all Israel stoned him with stones, so that he died. And king Rehoboam
         made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">19</span>So Israel rebelled against the house of David, unto this day. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation,
         and made him king over all Israel; there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, be assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore
         thousand chosen men that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam the son
         of Solomon. <span class="verse-number">22</span>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying: <span class="verse-number">23</span>‘Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the
         people, saying: <span class="verse-number">24</span>Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel; return every man to his house; for this thing
         is of Me.’ So they hearkened unto the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and returned and went their way, according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         
         
         
         
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">25</span>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel.
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Jeroboam said in his heart: ‘Now will the kingdom return to the house of David. <span class="verse-number">27</span>If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn back unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will
         kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.’ <span class="verse-number">28</span>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them: ‘Ye have gone up long enough to Jerusalem;
         behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And this thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah,
         and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, to sacrifice unto the calves that he had made; and he placed in Beth-el
         the priests of the high places that he had made. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which
         he had devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast 
         for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to offer.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 13
         </h3>And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> unto Beth-el; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he cried against the altar by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘O altar, altar, thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the
         high places that offer upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And he gave a sign the same day saying: ‘This is the sign which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam
         put forth his hand from the altar, saying: ‘Lay hold on him.’ And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that
         he could not draw it back to him. <span class="verse-number">5</span>The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by
         the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the king answered and said unto the man of God: ‘Entreat now the favour of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me.’ And the man of God entreated the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the king’s hand was restored him, and became as it was before. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the king said unto the man of God: ‘Come 
         
         
         
         
         home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the man of God said unto the king: ‘If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat
         bread nor drink water in this place. <span class="verse-number">9</span>For it so was charged me by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done
         that day in Beth-el, and the words which he had spoken unto the king, and they told them unto their father. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And their father said unto them: ‘What way went he?’ For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah.
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And he said unto his sons: ‘Saddle me the ass.’ So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a terebinth; and he said unto him: ‘Art thou the man of God
         that camest from Judah?’ And he said: ‘I am.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then he said unto him: ‘Come home with me, and eat bread.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And he said: ‘I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this
         place. <span class="verse-number">17</span>For it was said to me by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn back to go by the way that thou camest.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said unto him: ‘I 
         also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’—He lied unto him.—<span class="verse-number">19</span>So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">20</span>And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came unto the prophet that brought him back. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Forasmuch as thou hast rebelled against the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and hast not kept the commandment which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God commanded thee, <span class="verse-number">22</span>but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to thee: Eat no bread, and drink no water;
         thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, namely, for the prophet
         whom he had brought back. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him; and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it;
         the lion also stood by the carcass. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass; and they came and told
         it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said: ‘It is the man of God, who 
         
         
         
         
         rebelled against the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; therefore the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which He spoke unto him.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>And he spoke to his sons, saying: ‘Saddle me the ass.’ And they saddled it. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass; the lion had not eaten
         the carcass, nor torn the ass. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city
         of the old prophet, to lament, and to bury him. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they made lamentation for him: ‘Alas, my brother! ’ <span class="verse-number">31</span>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying: ‘When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre
         wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. <span class="verse-number">32</span>For the saying which he cried by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely
         come to pass.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">33</span>After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places;
         whosoever would, he consecrated him, that he might be one of the priests of the high places. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And by this thing there was sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the
         earth.  
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 14
         </h3>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Jeroboam said to his wife: ‘Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam;
         and get thee to Shiloh; behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people.
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>And take with thee ten loaves, and biscuits, and a cruse of honey, and go to him; he will tell thee what shall become of the
         child.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for
         his eyes were set by reason of his age. <span class="verse-number">5</span>Now the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said unto Ahijah: ‘Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick; thus and
         thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said: ‘Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam;
         why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Go, tell Jeroboam: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over My people Israel, <span class="verse-number">8</span>and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as My servant David, who kept
         My commandments, and who followed Me with all his 
         
         
         
         
         heart, to do that only which was right in Mine eyes; <span class="verse-number">9</span>but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke
         Me, and hast cast Me behind thy back; <span class="verse-number">10</span>therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, and him that
         is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away
         dung, till it be all gone. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat;

         there is found some good thing toward the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Moreover the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will raise Him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. But what is it even then? <span class="verse-number">15</span>for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will root up Israel out of this good land, which He gave to their
         fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River; because they have made their Asherim, provoking the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath 
         sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin.’

         down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. <span class="verse-number">14</span>But the high places were not taken away; nevertheless the heart of Asa was whole with the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> all his days.

         king of Judah. <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad,
         the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, that dwelt at Damascus, saying: <span class="verse-number">19</span>‘There is a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver
         and gold; go, break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may depart from me.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and
         Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And it came to pass, when Baasa heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
         thereof, wherewith Baasa had builded;

         saying: ‘Israel shall be thy name.’ <span class="verse-number">32</span>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And he said: ‘Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.’ And he said: ‘Do it the second
         time’; and they did it the second time. And he said: ‘Do it the third time’; and they did it the third time. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said: ‘O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant,
         and that I have done all these things at Thy word. <span class="verse-number">37</span>Hear me, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, hear me, that this people may know that Thou, <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, art God, for Thou didst turn their heart backward.’ <span class="verse-number">38</span>Then the fire of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the
         trench. <span class="verse-number">39</span>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, He is God; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, He is God.’ <span class="verse-number">40</span>And Elijah said unto them: ‘Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.’ And they took them; and Elijah brought
         them 
         down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">41</span>And Elijah said unto Ahab: ‘Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.’ <span class="verse-number">42</span>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and
         put his face between his knees. <span class="verse-number">43</span>And he said to his servant: ‘Go up now, look toward the sea.’ And he went up, and looked, and said: ‘There is nothing.’ And
         he said: ‘Go again seven times.’ <span class="verse-number">44</span>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said: ‘Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man’s
         hand.’ And he said: ‘Go up, say unto Ahab: Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.’ <span class="verse-number">45</span>And it came to pass in a little while, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab
         rode, and went to Jezreel. <span class="verse-number">46</span>And the hand of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 19
         </h3>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying: ‘So let the gods do [to me], and more also, if I make not thy life as the
         life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and 
         
         
         
         
         left his servant there. <span class="verse-number">4</span>But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom-tree; and he requested for himself
         that he might die; and said: ‘It is enough; now, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he lay down and slept under a broom-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him: ‘Arise and eat.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the hot stones, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and
         drink, and laid him down again. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came again the second time, and touched him, and said: ‘Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meal forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount

         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to him, and He said unto him: ‘What doest thou here, Elijah?’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And he said: ‘I have been very jealous for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets
         with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And He said: ‘Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ And, behold, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> 
         was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not in the earthquake; <span class="verse-number">12</span>and after the earthquake a fire; but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the
         cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said: ‘What doest thou here, Elijah?’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he said: ‘I have been very jealous for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets

         <span class="verse-number">15</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto him: ‘Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be
         king over Aram; <span class="verse-number">16</span>and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou
         anoint to be prophet in thy room. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the
         sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. <span class="verse-number">18</span>Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed
         him.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen 
         
         
         
         
         before him, and he with the twelfth; and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said: ‘Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
         follow thee.’ And he said unto him: ‘Go back; for what have I done to thee?’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments
         of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

            									Chapter 20
         </h3>And Ben-hadad the king of Aram gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and
         chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, <span class="verse-number">3</span>and said unto him: ‘Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest,
         are mine.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the king of Israel answered and said: ‘It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king: I am thine, and all that I have.’
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the messengers came again, and said: ‘Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying: I sent indeed unto thee, saying: Thou shalt deliver
         me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; <span class="verse-number">6</span>but I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants;
         and it shall 
         be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said: ‘Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief;
         for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And all the elders and all the people said unto him: ‘Hearken thou not, neither consent.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad: ‘Tell my lord the king: All that thou didst send for to thy servant at
         the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.’ And the messengers departed, and brought him back word. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said: ‘The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls
         for all the people that follow me.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the king of Israel answered and said: ‘Tell him: Let not him that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that putteth
         it off.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And it came to pass, when [Ben-hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the booths, that he said
         unto his servants: ‘Set yourselves in array.’ And they set themselves in array against the city.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ 
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Ahab said: ‘By whom?’ And he said: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: By the young men of the princes of the provinces.’ Then he said: ‘Who shall begin the battle?’ And he answered: ‘Thou.’
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he
         numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings
         that helped him. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying: ‘There
         are men come out from Samaria.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said: ‘Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they are come out for war, take them alive.’
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And they slew every one his man; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the king of Aram escaped on
         a horse with horsemen. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Arameans with a great slaughter. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him: ‘Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest;
         for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.’  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him: ‘Their God is a God of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we;
         but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their room: <span class="verse-number">25</span>and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against
         them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.’ And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans, and went up to Aphek, to fight against
         Israel. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them; and the children of Israel encamped
         before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Arameans filled the country. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And a man of God came near and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Because the Arameans have said: The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is a God of the hills, but he is not a God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand,
         and ye shall know that I am the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and
         the children of Israel slew of the Arameans a hundred thousand footmen in one day. <span class="verse-number">30</span>But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall 
         
         
         
         
         fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">31</span>And his servants said unto him: ‘Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us,
         we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will
         save thy life.’ <span class="verse-number">32</span>So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said: ‘Thy servant
         Ben-hadad saith: I pray thee, let me live.’ And he said: ‘Is he yet alive? he is my brother.’ <span class="verse-number">33</span>Now the men took it for a sign, and hastened to catch it from him; and they said: ‘Thy brother Ben-hadad.’ Then he said: ‘Go
         ye, bring him.’ Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into his chariot. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And [Ben-hadad] said unto him: ‘The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets
         for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.’ ’And I , said Ahab, will let thee go with this covenant.’ So he made
         a covenant with him, and let him go.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">35</span>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: ‘Smite me, I pray thee.’ And the man refused to smite him. <span class="verse-number">36</span>Then said he unto him: ‘Because thou hast not heartened to the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, behold, as soon 
         as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.’ And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him; and slew
         him. <span class="verse-number">37</span>Then he found another man, and said: ‘Smite me, I pray thee.’ And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him. <span class="verse-number">38</span>So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. <span class="verse-number">39</span>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said: ‘Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold,
         a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said: Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life
         be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. <span class="verse-number">40</span>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.’ And the king of Israel said unto him: ‘So shall thy judgment be;
         thyself hast decided it.’ <span class="verse-number">41</span>And he hastened, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
         <span class="verse-number">42</span>And he said unto him: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his
         life, and thy people for his people.’ <span class="verse-number">43</span>And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria.

         </h3>And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace
         of Ahab, king of Samaria. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Ahab spoke 
         
         
         
         
         unto Naboth, saying: ‘Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and
         I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.’
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Naboth said to Ahab: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Ahab came into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for
         he had said: ‘I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.’ And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his
         face, and would eat no bread.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him: ‘Why is thy spirit so sullen, that thou eatest no bread?’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And he said unto her: ‘Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him: Give me thy vineyard for money; or else,
         if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it; and he answered: I will not give thee my vineyard.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Jezebel his wife said unto him: ‘Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be
         merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
         that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And she wrote in the letters, saying: ‘Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people; <span class="verse-number">10</span>and set two men, base 
         fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying: Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according
         as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. <span class="verse-number">12</span>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him; and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against
         Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying: ‘Naboth did curse God and the king.’ Then they carried him forth out of the
         city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying: ‘Naboth is stoned, and is dead.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab: ‘Arise, take possession
         of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
         to take possession of it.

         <span class="verse-number">27</span>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his 
         flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softy. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: <span class="verse-number">29</span>‘Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before Me? because he humbleth himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days;
         but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.’  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 22
         </h3>And they continued three years without war between Aram and Israel. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the king of Israel said unto his servants: ‘Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out
         of the hand of the king of Aram?’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And he said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?’ And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel:
         ‘I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: ‘Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> today.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them: ‘Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead
         to battle, or shall I forbear?’ And they said: ‘Go up; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will deliver it into the hand of the king.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>But Jehoshaphat said: ‘Is there not here besides a prophet of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that we might inquire of him?’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, 
         
         
         
         
         Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.’ And Jehoshaphat said: ‘Let
         not the king say so.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said: ‘Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in a threshing-floor,
         at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying: ‘Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will deliver it into the hand of the king.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying: ‘Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto
         the king with one mouth, let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Micaiah said: ‘As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, what the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> saith unto me, that will I speak.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him: ‘Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?’
         And he answered him: ‘Go up, and prosper; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will deliver it into the hand of the king.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the king said unto him: ‘How many times shall I adjure thee 
         that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>?’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said: ‘I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: ‘Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?’
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>And he said: ‘Therefore hear thou the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. I saw the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on his left. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead. And one said: On this manner; and another said:
         On that manner. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And there came forth the spirit, and stood before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: I will entice him. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto him: Wherewith? And he said: I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And
         He said: Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also; go forth, and do so. <span class="verse-number">23</span>Now therefore, behold, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath spoken evil concerning thee.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the check, and said: ‘Which way went the spirit of the
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> from me to speak unto thee?’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And Micaiah said: ‘Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt 
         
         
         
         
         go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.’ <span class="verse-number">26</span>And the king of Israel said: ‘Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s
         son; <span class="verse-number">27</span>and say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with scant bread and with scant water, until I come
         in peace.’ <span class="verse-number">28</span>And Micaiah said: ‘If thou return at all in peace, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath not spoken by me.’ And he said: ‘Hear, ye peoples, all of you.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: ‘I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.’
         And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. <span class="verse-number">31</span>Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying: ‘Fight neither with small nor great,
         save only with the king of Israel.’ <span class="verse-number">32</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: ‘Surely it is the king of Israel’;
         and they turned aside to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from
         pursuing him. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore
         he said unto the driver of his chariot: ‘Turn thy hand, and carry me out of 
         the host; for I am sore wounded.’ <span class="verse-number">35</span>And the battle increased that day; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Arameans, and died at even; and the
         blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying: ‘Every man to his city, and every man to
         his country.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">37</span>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. <span class="verse-number">38</span>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; the harlots also washed themselves there;
         according unto the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> which He spoke.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">39</span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built,
         are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <span class="verse-number">40</span>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">41</span>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. <span class="verse-number">42</span>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his
         mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <span class="verse-number">43</span>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; <span class="verse-number">44</span>howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high 
         
         
         
         
         places. <span class="verse-number">45</span>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">46</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book
         of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <span class="verse-number">47</span>And the remnant of the sodomites that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. <span class="verse-number">48</span> And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king. <span class="verse-number">49</span> Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
         <span class="verse-number">50</span>Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat: ‘Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.’ But Jehoshaphat would
         not. <span class="verse-number">51</span>And 
         Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoram his son reigned
         in his stead.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">52</span>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he
         reigned two years over Israel. <span class="verse-number">53</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein
         he made Israel to sin. <span class="verse-number">54</span>And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
